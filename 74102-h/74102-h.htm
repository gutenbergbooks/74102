<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>On publishing the first two volumes of this work, it
was not my intention that the following volumes
should be preceded by any preface. I have, however,
been induced to reconsider this resolution, in
order to acknowledge the ready assistance I have
received from men of great experience, not only
of this but of foreign countries. My first volume
treats more especially of the antiquities of the mercantile
marine, and closes with the sixteenth century.
In the second, I trace the progress of maritime commerce
down to about the close of the great French
War (1815), when a new era dawned and a new
state of things was inaugurated. Details, relating
in an especial manner to this period, form the subject
of my last two volumes—in one I treat of the
Navigation Laws of Cromwell and of the causes
which led to their abolition, together with the
effects of their abolition; while the other is devoted,
entirely, to the rise and progress of steam-ships and
to the different branches of commerce in which they
are engaged.</p>

<p>In order to render this portion of my labours
valuable for the purpose of reference, I have sought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
the aid of those best able to afford me trustworthy
information, and to supply me with documents and
tables of unquestionable authenticity.</p>

<p>To none am I more deeply indebted in this respect
than to Mr. Farrer and others, of the Board of Trade,
whose kindly promptitude I again acknowledge. For
that part relating to France I have profited by the
valuable aid of Mr. Michael Chevalier, who has not
grudged the pains of carefully and critically revising
the proofs of that portion of the work, and making
many interesting additions to it.</p>

<p>Nor must I omit to record the readiness exhibited
by Mr. R. B. Forbes, of Boston, United States, by
Commodore Prebble, Commandant of the Philadelphia
Dockyard, and by the Presidents of the New York
and other American Chambers of Commerce, and to
the United States authorities generally, in supplying
me with official data with reference to the development
of the maritime commerce of the United States.</p>

<p>To my own countrymen, whether Shipowners,
Merchants, Shipbuilders, or Underwriters, my thanks
are heartily due, and to the Directors and Managers
of those large Shipping Companies which arose in
the middle of the present century, both at home and
abroad. And, in an especial manner I have to thank
Mr. John Burns, of Glasgow (Cunard Company),
Mr. Alfred Holt, of Liverpool, and Mr. B. Waymouth,
the Secretary to ‘Lloyd’s Register.’</p>

<p>To enumerate all those who have so courteously
and generously striven to forward the views of an
historian whose only object has been to chronicle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</span>
facts and events, would be to give an undue extension
to these prefatory remarks. I have, therefore, contented
myself with acknowledging the sources of my
information in foot-notes throughout my work; and
I trust they will accept my thanks in the sense in
which they are tendered.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I must refer to the kind attention
paid to my request by Earl Russell, in revising that
portion of my work which refers to the repeal of the
Navigation Laws when he was First Minister of the
Crown; and to other eminent Statesmen (two of
whom have gone through the whole of the sheets
of both volumes, making many valuable suggestions)
for the approval expressed by them of the manner
in which I have compressed the debates on these
Laws which have now passed into the domain of
history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress
of the
United
States of
America.</div>

<p>Perhaps no nation, in either ancient or modern
times, ever made such prodigious strides in wealth,
population, and power, and, necessarily, in commerce
and navigation, as have the United States of America
during the first half of the present century. Nor is
this a matter for surprise. Practically, the American
people had during that period started in life with the
singular advantage, that they commenced their career
with the accumulated wisdom of a long ancestry,
with whom, unlike the nations of ancient times, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
have continued to have the means of easy communication.
Therefore, they had the capability of assuming,
almost at once, an important position in the
world, and of exercising no mean influence over its
affairs, having few of those difficulties to encounter,
which European nations, in their slow emergence
from a state of political and intellectual darkness,
have taken centuries to surmount.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their resources.</div>

<p>Finding themselves in a safe geographical position,
with the most magnificent harbours on every
part of their coast, already prepared by the hand of
nature for their use, with the greatest navigable
rivers in the world, with lakes which are inland
seas, and with boundless virgin soil at their disposal:
wanting nothing, in short, but wise laws
and abundant labour, they speedily discovered their
strength, and, in their earlier debates, in Congress
gravely discussed the question whether they should
not style themselves the most enlightened people in
the world.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Nor, indeed, was this boast altogether
vain and baseless, for the Americans were in a position
to adopt, as they might choose, the whole sum
of human knowledge, with the power, at the same
time, of applying this knowledge to the satisfaction
of their varying wants.</p>

<p>Their capacity for government, in its application
to commerce and navigation, equalled, if it did not
surpass, that of the race whence they descended; and
their system of education, the only true basis of a nation’s
greatness, far surpassed that of Great Britain;
hence, in all diplomatic negotiations, relating either
to their political independence or to their material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
interests, they have generally exhibited such marked
tact, ability, and acuteness, as has enabled them frequently
to obtain ample redress from foreign nations,
and often, too, without that formal demand which, if
not complied with, leads to war: from their example
a few of our diplomatists, who reside abroad, would
do well to take a lesson.</p>

<p>With these elements of knowledge, wealth, and
national power, combined with a martial spirit,
readily kindled into action whenever the necessity
arose, the Americans, under an extremely liberal
government, have rapidly and deservedly assumed
a proud position among nations. Not the least interesting
and instructive cause of their rise was the
promptitude with which they developed, by the then
best known means, their great natural resources, and
none more so than their maritime commerce, for,
within eighty years from their Declaration of Independence,
they rivalled, and, indeed, surpassed in
the amount of their merchant shipping, all other
nations.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Discriminating
duties
levied by
France,
1820,
against
American
ships.</div>

<p>Nor was that high position reached without innumerable
difficulties in the shape of laws adverse
to her interests. Great Britain excluded her ships
from all her colonies; and, though France had ceded
to her by treaty in 1803, for the sum of fifteen
million dollars, the State of Louisiana, that country
for many years afterwards continued to levy heavy
differential duties on all goods imported into France
in American bottoms, while American shipowners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
had to contend at their port of export against the
predominant interests of a country whose settlers
for a long time greatly outnumbered the native
Americans resident in New Orleans. Indeed, so late
as 1820, a long memorial<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was presented to Congress
from twenty-four captains of American vessels then
lying at New Orleans, stating that they “cannot
earn a competent livelihood, owing to the fatal discriminating
duties established in France in favour of
its own vessels in the exclusive importation there of
the staples of the United States.” The memorialists<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
further alleged that on some articles the duty was
“ten times” in favour of French vessels, and that
the “aggregate importation in French vessels at the
port of New Orleans exceeded very much in <i>quantity</i>
the amount imported by American vessels;” being
in the proportion of “nearly four to one.” In confirmation
of these statements the memorialists furnished
a return from the Customs which demonstrated
that the carrying trade between New Orleans and
France was being then rapidly transferred from
American to French vessels; and they stated that
the only reason why the French did not absorb the
whole trade, was that they had not a sufficient
number of vessels to undertake it. The petitioners
further insisted that nothing but “a positive tonnage
duty,” graduated according to the amount of the
differential duties levied in France on the chief
American staples, would avail to keep their trade in
their own hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Rapid rise
of New
Orleans</div>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of these hostile tariffs, and
the war of retaliating duties which was for some
time waged, New Orleans, from being the natural
emporium of the vast tracts of country traversed by
the Mississippi, Missouri, and their tributary streams,
and enjoying, as it does, a greater command of internal
navigation than any other city in either the
Old or New World, has made since 1820 the most
astounding strides in its maritime commerce.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">and of
New York.</div>

<p>But in the face of equal difficulties as regards
hostile tariffs, New York, through the great natural
resources at her command, and other causes, surpassed
New Orleans in the rapidity of its early
commercial and maritime progress. Although its
advancement during the first decade of the present
century was scarcely equal to that of the preceding
ten years, during which it enjoyed unexceptionable
prosperity (no other city in the United States having
profited so much, during the earlier periods, by the
war in Europe), its merchants and shipowners suffered
severely between 1806 and 1815 from the
disastrous effects of captures, condemnations, and
embargoes. Nor was it until 1825 that New York
began to assume the importance which she has continued
to maintain among the other commercial cities
of the Union. In that year an internal element of
prosperity was brought into operation by the construction
of the Erie Canal, which opened for trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
the agricultural products of the fertile valley of the
Tennessee, and the whole coasts of the northern lakes.
The introduction of steam-navigation, to which I
shall fully refer hereafter, affording greatly increased
facilities for the conveyance of merchandise to and
from New York by means of the numerous navigable
rivers which intersected that and the neighbouring
States, naturally gave an enormous impulse to its

<p>Nor was the prosperity confined to New York. It
extended for many years to all the ports of the
Union. Boston, which, twenty years before the
Declaration of Independence, was only a village containing
about twenty houses, and, so late as 1822, was
still governed by a body of “select men,” according
to the custom of New England [the people, till then,
declining to adopt a municipal government], vied
with New York in the Foreign Trade which had
arisen, and early in the present century despatched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
their vessels on the most distant voyages. Indeed,
so early as 1789, the merchants of Boston and Salem
sent various ships direct to the East Indies and
China, and, many years before the “Free Traders”
of Great Britain could enter upon this trade, then
monopolised by the ships of the East India Company,
so far as regards Great Britain, the merchants<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
of Massachusetts supplied, not merely their own
people with the bulk of the teas, spices, silks, sugar
and coffee from the East as well as with nankeens and
other cotton clothes, but reshipped them from Boston
to Hamburg and the Northern ports of Europe in
their own vessels, thus deriving large profits from a
trade with our possessions, from which the great
bulk of our ships were long excluded by the stringent
restrictions of a pernicious monopoly.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Mercantile
marine
laws of the
United
States.</div>

<p>We have thus seen with what rapidity the
Americans, in their early career, covered almost
every ocean with their ships. As in other matters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
so in the rules and regulations drawn up for the
internal management of their marine, they were
able, at the commencement of their independence,
to adopt from other nations such laws, even to their
most minute details, as appeared to them the best
fitted for their position. Thus, one of their earliest
Acts, that of 1790, provides: that, “if a seaman
is engaged without the execution of the shipping
paper, the master or mariner shall pay to the
seaman the highest wages that have been given
within the three months next before the time of
such shipping;” and the principle of this law has
been long maintained, for the Act of 1840 declares
that “any seaman so shipped may, at any time,
leave the service, and demand the highest rate of
wages given to any seaman shipped for the voyage.”
In the Bank and Cod-fisheries, the contract of
seamen with the masters and owners is required
to be in writing, expressing the general terms of the
voyage; and in the Whale-fishery, though the
shipping paper is not absolutely required by the law,
there is still a regular engagement, generally in
writing, stipulating, among other things, the terms
of the voyage, and the shares or “lays” of each
officer and seaman on board the ship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duties of
master and
mate.</div>

<p>The several modes in which seamen’s contracts are
executed, are the hiring by the month or by the
voyage so long as it shall continue, or for a share
of the profits, or of the freight earned in certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
voyages. The American law invests the master
with the sole government of his ship and the
absolute right of direction, subject to the legal consequences
of any abuse of his powers. He may
enforce his authority by the infliction of punishment
upon the crew, but, should he exceed these limits, he
is liable, by a Statute of the United States, to an
action for damages in the Civil Courts, and to a
criminal prosecution. The measure of punishment
proportioned to the offence is to be ascertained by
the special circumstances of the case; but all punishments
must be inflicted with proper instruments.
Hence, while the master has power to punish a
seaman and to imprison him on board, to prevent
a violation of the order and peace of the ship, he
must be prepared to show that such measures were
necessary.</p>

<p>The duties of mate, as laid down by the United
States, resemble those of other countries. In the
absence or death of the master he takes his place,
exercising a general superintendence over the affairs
of the ship. But his ordinary duties are confined
to calling the attention of the master to everything
requiring his notice, to the receipt and stowage of
cargo, and to whatever is necessary for the proper
equipment and sailing of the vessel while at sea.
The mate is also required to keep the log-book,
wherein he is bound to enter every matter of importance,
such as the courses steered, the winds, and
state of the weather, with many other minute
details connected with the navigation of the ship.
If he is guilty of such negligence as to involve the
loss of his cargo, he alone is responsible; and if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
interferes with the responsibility, of others he renders
himself responsible. Thus, if he undertakes, while in
harbour, the removal of any merchandise, resulting
in loss, the amount may be deducted from his
wages, it being the rule, that the wharfinger is
responsible for the safe delivery of all goods on
board the vessel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Provision
for
seamen.</div>

<p>The American law has, also, provided for the
proper sustenance of seamen, by requiring that a
certain amount of the provisions shipped be set apart
for this purpose, and, further, that they shall be
provided for during <i>bonâ fide</i> sicknesses occurring
during the service of the ship, and not from the
seamen’s own fault, when absent occasionally or
without express permission. All vessels bound for
any ports beyond the limits of the United States are
to be provided with a medicine chest. Provision,
moreover, is made for sick and disabled seamen on
shore, the law enjoining on the master or owner of
every vessel the payment towards the maintenance
of hospitals on shore, into the hands of the Collector
of Customs of 20 cents per month for every seaman
in their employ. This sum is deducted from
the wages of the seamen, and is required from all
seamen alike, whether in the coasting or oversea
trades.</p>

<p>Barratry committed by the master or mariner
is treated as in England. Running away with or
destroying the ship, mutiny, piracy, piratical confederacy,
endeavouring to create a revolt, desertion,
embezzlement, negligence, drunkenness, and disobedience,
are all regarded as grave offences, and
punished in a greater or less degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Special
Acts relating
to
them.</div>

<p>By the Act of the 20th February, 1803, it was
provided that the master of any merchant vessel,
clearing for a foreign port, should enter into a bond
in the sum of 400<i>l.</i> for the production of his crew at
the first port at which he should arrive on his return
to the United States, unless any one or more of the
crew had been discharged in a foreign country, with
the consent of the American consul or commercial
agent of the United States, except in the case of
death, of absconding, or of forcible impressment into
some other service. This Act, likewise, provided that,
when a vessel was sold abroad, and the crew discharged
by mutual consent, the master should pay to
the consul for any seaman thus discharged three
months’ wages over and above those he had earned
up to the time of his discharge; two-thirds thereof
to be paid to the seaman himself, on his engagement
to return to the United States, and the
remaining third to be retained towards a fund for
the payment of the passages for seamen, citizens of
the United States, who may be desirous of returning
home; and for the maintenance of destitute American
seamen resident at the port of discharge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Power
given to
American
consuls</div>

<p>Although many persons were of opinion that the
Act of 1803, requiring, under the circumstances
named, a payment of three months’ extra wages, and
empowering consuls to send seamen home, disabled
or otherwise, “in the most reasonable manner,”
frequently led to improper expenditure, and that a
more strict accountability, than then existed, ought
to be enforced, these clauses remained unaltered until
1840, when their features were changed; consuls
and commercial agents of the United States being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
by the Act of the 20th July of that year invested
with the power to discharge, when they thought it
“expedient,” any seaman, on the joint application of
the master of the ship and the seaman himself, without
requiring payment of any sum beyond the wages
due at the time of discharge.</p>

<p>The Act, however, of 1840 created so many objections
of another kind, that it became necessary,
shortly afterwards, to make various alterations. It
was felt that the discretion given to the consuls
was likely to operate unfortunately for all parties
concerned. Acting, as the consuls then very frequently
did, in the double capacity of agent for the
United States and consignee of the vessel, they
were too often induced to gratify the wishes of the
owner and master to the injury of the seaman. Consequently,
either the American consular establishments
had to be re-organised upon a more independent
system, or the “expediency” clauses had
to be abolished. But other and still more weighty
reasons suggested the desirability of adopting the
former course. While, at a later period, the discretionary
power was abolished, except in cases of
sickness and insubordination, arrangements were
made to disconnect Government agencies entirely
from commercial operations. Now, all consuls, who
must be exclusively American citizens, are remunerated
by fixed salaries, instead of fees as formerly,
and are removed from the possibility of all interested
connexion with shipowners and shipmasters; by
being, in nearly every instance, as is now the case
with the consuls of Great Britain, prohibited from
carrying on business on their own account—at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
such business as can in any way interfere with their
duties as consul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">to deal
with
seamen on
their
ships.</div>

<p>But it has been necessary also to make several
other material alterations in the maritime laws. By
the Act of 1790, it was provided that if any seaman
deserted, or even absented himself for forty-eight
hours without leave from his ship, he forfeited to
the master or owner of the vessel all the wages due
to him, and all his goods and chattels on board, or
in any store where they were deposited at the time
of such desertion or absence, besides other penalties.
This forfeiture might be necessary or proper to
check desertion; but it was easy to see, that it was
in the highest degree unwise, that it should be given
for the use of the master or owner of the ship. It
tended, indeed, to produce the very effect and mischief
it was intended to prevent. Masters of American
vessels, when nearing a port where a new crew could
be shipped at reduced wages, and when in arrears
to their seamen (a fact which often occurs in long
whaling voyages), were apt to adopt a course of
tyrannical conduct, with the desire of compelling
desertion; and, on their arrival, to permit their
sailors a temporary absence from the ship, and then
to leave them, under the plea of desertion, as a
charge on the hands of the consul.</p>

<p>One flagrant instance was mentioned by the consul
at Lima, of a supercargo of a vessel, who stated that
he had saved in one voyage alone more than 1000
dollars by the desertion of his hands, as if this were
a fair source of profit to either owner or master.</p>

<p>The simple entry in the log-book of the fact of
absence or desertion was, then, deemed conclusive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
against the seaman. Hence a very large sum was
necessarily expended by the American Government
in providing for destitute seamen. But this was
partly attributable to the general increase of the
United States commerce, and not altogether to the
defective working of the law. While the aggregate
amount of the registered tonnage of the United
States in 1830 was about 576,000 tons, it had
reached in 1840, 899,000, showing an increase of
323,000 in ten years,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but the increase of seamen
applying for relief at distant consulates had at that
time, it would seem, gone far beyond the general
increase in the amount of shipping.</p>

<p>The whole question of the relations between the
men and their employers, as they existed in the
United States, is too wide a subject to be embraced
in the present work. There are, however, some
general, as well as special, points, both as regards
the mariners and the law regulating their conduct,
which deserve attention. During the first half of
this century the masters of American vessels were,
as a rule, greatly superior to those who held similar
positions in English ships, arising in some measure
from the limited education of the latter, which
was not sufficient to qualify them for the higher
grades of the merchant service. American shipowners
required of their masters not merely a knowledge
of navigation and seamanship, but of commercial
pursuits, the nature of exchanges, the art of
correspondence, and a sufficient knowledge of business
to qualify them to represent the interests of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
their employers to advantage with merchants abroad.
On all such matters the commanders of English ships,
with the exception of the East India Company’s,
were at this period greatly inferior to the commanders
of the United States vessels.</p>

<p>“Education,” remarks Mr. Joseph T. Sherwood,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
“is much prized by the citizens; many vessels,
therefore, are commanded by gentlemen with a
college education, and by those educated in high
schools, who, on leaving those institutions, enter a
merchant’s counting-room for a limited time before
they go to sea for practical seamanship, &amp;c., or are
entrusted by their parents, guardians, or friends,
with the command of vessels.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superiority
of
native
American
seamen,
owing to
their education.</div>

<p>In confirmation of this opinion, Mr. Consul Peter,
of Philadelphia, states<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>: “A lad intended for the
higher grades of the merchant service in this country,
after having been at school for some years and acquired
(in addition to the ordinary branches of school
learning) a competent knowledge of Mathematics,
Navigation, Ships’ husbandry, and perhaps French,
is generally apprenticed to some respectable merchant,
in whose counting-house he remains two or three
years, or at least until he becomes familiar with
exchanges and such other commercial matters as may
best qualify him to represent his principal in foreign
countries. He is then sent to sea, generally in the
capacity of second mate, from which he gradually
rises to that of captain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Besides this, however, it must be remembered
that American shipowners offered greater inducements
than the English then did to young men of
talent and education to enter the merchant service,
as the amount of wages, alone, was two- and three-fold
greater in the former than in the latter. Again,
the American shipmasters were, also, almost invariably
admitted, nay frequently solicited by the
managing owners, to take some shares in the ships
placed under their command; and, in cases, where
the master had no capital, the owner often conveyed
to him a share of one-sixth, and sometimes even one
quarter, to be paid for out of his wages and the profits
of the ships. Thus young men of good position and
talent were led to enter the American merchant
service, and had much greater inducements than they
would then have had in Great Britain to take a zealous
interest in the economy, discipline, and success of the
ship they commanded; and this, not merely from
the fact that they were well recommended, but
from the confidential and courteous treatment they
received from their employers. Captains of the
larger class of packets or merchant-ships, therefore,
could not only afford to live as gentlemen, but, if men
of good character and fair manners (which they generally
were), they were received into the best mercantile
circles on shore. They were also allowed, besides
their fixed salary, a percentage (usually 2½ per cent.)
on all freights, and by various other privileges (particularly
in relation to passengers) they were thus enabled
to save money and to become, in time, merchants
and shipowners on their own account, a custom which
prevailed, to a large extent, in the New England States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Excellent
schools
and early training
for them.</div>

<p>Nor were the interests of the common seamen overlooked.
Boys of all classes, when fit, had the privilege
of entering the higher free schools, in which
they could be educated for almost every profession.
An ignorant American native seaman was, therefore,
scarcely to be found; they all, with few exceptions,
knew how to read, write, and cypher. Although,
in all nations, a mariner is considered a citizen
of the world, whose home is on the sea, and, as
such, can enforce compensation for his labour in the
Courts of any country, his contract being recognised
by general jurisprudence, the cases of disputes
between <i>native-born</i> Americans and their captains
have ever been less frequent both in this country
and abroad than between British masters and seamen,
owing, in a great measure, to the superior
education and the more rigorous discipline on board
American vessels. In the United States, the master
of the ship was, and is still, usually employed to
hire the seamen; and although, in hiring, he is the
agent of the owners (and they have co-ordinate
power), still if they do not dissent, the engagement
entered into by the master with the seamen is binding
on the owners also. The contract is, however, not
made with the person of the master, but with the
shipowners; therefore, if there is no master, the seamen
contract to sail under any master who may be
appointed. Thus, on the one side of the contract is
the seaman, and, on the other, the master or owner—the
master acting as the owner’s agent, under
ordinary circumstances, although the owner, from his
holding the property in the ship, is more directly
affected by the contract.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Spirit and
character
of the
“Shipping
Articles,”</div>

<p>The master and owner, on their side, agree by the
contract, technically termed “Shipping Articles,”
which, if drawn up in the prescribed form and signed
by all the seamen, expresses the conditions of the
voyage, with a promise to pay to the mariners their
stipulated wages. It is, also, implied in it that the
voyage shall be legal, and the vessel provided with
the various requisites for navigation; and, further,
that it shall be within defined limits and without
deviation, except such as may be absolutely necessary
for the safety of the crew, vessel, or cargo. It
is also a part of the contract that the seamen shall
be treated with humanity, and be provided with subsistence
according to the laws of their country;
unless there is in it an express provision to the contrary,
or a condition to conform with the usages
of a particular trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">as affecting
the
seamen;</div>

<p>The seaman, on his side, by the act of signing the
“Shipping Articles,” contracts to do all in his power
for the welfare of the ship; engages that he has competent
knowledge for the performance of the duties of
the station for which he contracts; to be on board at
the precise time which, by American law, constitutes
a part of the articles; and to remain in the service
of the ship till the voyage has been completed. If
he does not so report himself on board the vessel, he
may be apprehended and committed to the custody
of the law till the ship is ready to sail. He contracts
also to obey all the lawful commands of the master;
to preserve order and discipline aboard, and to submit,
as a child to its parent, for the purpose of securing
such order and discipline during the voyage.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">the
owners;</div>

<p>As in England, the owners have the right of removing
a master, who is part owner of a vessel; but,
if he is removed without good cause, and while at the
same time specially engaged, they are liable to him
for damages. Where, however, he has only a general
engagement with a vessel, his relation to the owners
is scarcely more than a mere agency, revocable at any
time. On the other hand, the master cannot leave
the ship in which he has contracted to sail without
being himself answerable to the owners.</p>

<p>The authority of a master over his ship is in all
essential particulars the same as that prescribed by
British law. With regard to letting the ship, the
same principles prevail on both sides of the Atlantic.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In general the owners are responsible for injuries
committed by the master in that capacity, as in cases
of collision, discharges of mariners, damages to cargo
from want of ordinary care, and embezzlement. The
master is answerable for all contracts made by him
in connexion with the navigation of a ship, as also
for all damages arising from his want of skill or
care, and for repairs and supplies, except when
furnished on the exclusive credit of the owner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and the
masters or
consignees.</div>

<p>If the master of a ship is at the same time commander
and consignee, he stands in the twofold
relation of agent of the owner and consignor, and is
invested with appropriate duties in both capacities.
Inasmuch as the master and owner are in the eyes of
the American law common carriers, it is the master’s
duty to see that his vessel is seaworthy and provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
with a proper crew, to take a pilot, where required by
custom or law, to stow the goods properly, to set sail
in fair weather, to transport the cargo with care, and
to provide against all but inevitable mishaps. In
other respects, American and English laws are almost
identical; the admirable decisions of Judge Story,
Chancellor Kent, and Chief Justice Marshall having,
however, made some refined distinctions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conditions
of
wages,</div>

<div class="sidenote">and remedies
for
their non-payment;
and the
other
securities
for seamen.</div>

<p>As it was considered the duty of sailors to remain
by their vessel till the cargo was discharged, they
had no claim to their wages till then, but, if these
were not paid within ten days after such discharge,
they had a right to an admiralty process against the
vessel. Only one-third of the wages earned can be
demanded by the mariner at any port of delivery
during the voyage. There may be on this subject a
special stipulation; but, if the ship be lost or captured,
wages earned up to the last port of delivery
may be recovered by the mariner, on his return home,
to the place to which the vessel has carried freight;
freight being by the laws of all nations “the Mother
of Wages:” inasmuch, however, as they depend upon
the vessel’s safety and the earning of the freight, they
cannot be insured. In all cases of capture, the seamen
lose their wages, unless the ship is restored. In
cases of rescue, recapture, and ransom, the wages
of mariners are subject to a general average, but
in no other case are they liable to contribute. In
cases of shipwreck the rule prevails, as elsewhere,
that, if parts of the ship be saved by the exertions of
the seamen, they hold a lien on those parts for some
kind of compensation, but this is viewed somewhat
in the light of salvage. When a seaman dies on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
board ship, wages are usually allowed up to the time
of his decease, if the cause of death occurred during
the term of his engagement, and otherwise than by
his own fault. In the whale-fishery, the representatives
of a deceased mariner are entitled to that share
of the profits which the term of his service bore to
the whole voyage, according to his contract. If a
voyage is broken up by the fault of the master or
owner, full compensation must be given to the
seaman; so also, in cases of wrongful discharge, the
seaman usually recovers full indemnification in American
Courts of law. Indeed they have more
effectual remedies for the recovery of their wages
than the seamen of most other countries, from the
fact that Americans have followed the ancient laws
already quoted: moreover, they have their remedy
against the master, and can recover their wages from
him personally, or from the owner or owners of the
vessel, or from the person who appointed the master
and gave him his authority.</p>

<p>For personal injuries inflicted by the master upon
the seamen, such as assaults, batteries, or imprisonments,
the seaman in the United States has his
remedy by an action at common law, or by a libel
in the Admiralty Courts, in what is technically
denominated “a cause of damage.” So, also, in a
wrongful discharge, an action would be not only on
the special tort committed, but also for the wages
on the original contract of hiring, the wrongful
discharge being void.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Power of
appeal by
them to
the Admiralty
Courts.</div>

<p>In order to institute suits in the Courts of Admiralty
in the United States it is necessary that the
voyage should be on tidal waters, and that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
service on which suit is brought should be connected
with commerce and navigation. The jurisdiction of
those Courts in America extends to personal suits,
and includes claims founded in contract and in
wrong, and also those cases where claims, founded
in a hypothecary interest of the nature of a lien,
are urged and adjudicated upon. Their jurisdiction
extends, moreover, to those cases in which shares
of fish, taken on the Bank and other Cod-fisheries,
and of oil in the Whale-fishery, are claimed; and,
as in English Courts, the seaman may unite his
claims, though founded on distinct contracts, in one
suit, but this only when demanding wages. The
Courts of Common Law in the United States also
take cognizance of mariners’ contracts, but they are
not competent to give a remedy so as to enforce the
mariner’s lien on the vessel; hence, they confine
their jurisdiction to personal suits against the master
or owner, in accordance with the contract made with
the seaman; but, in cases of tort committed on the
high seas, and where the form of action is trespass,
or a special action, the common law has concurrent
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The laws of the United States<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> expressly provide
that the crews of merchant vessels shall have the
fullest liberty to lay their complaints before their
consuls abroad, and shall in no respect be restrained
therein by any master or officer, unless some sufficient
and valid objection exist against their landing,
in which case it is the duty of the master to apprize
the consul forthwith, stating the reason why the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
seaman is not permitted to land; whereupon, the
consul must proceed on board, and act as the law
directs. In all cases where deserters are apprehended
the consul is required to investigate the facts,
and, if satisfied that the desertion was caused by
unusual or cruel treatment, the mariner shall be, in
such case, not merely discharged, but shall receive,
in addition to his wages, three months’ pay, and the
whole act is required to be entered upon the crew-list
and shipping articles, with full particulars of the
nature of this treatment. Any consul or commercial
agent of the United States neglecting or omitting to
perform his duties, or guilty of malversation or abuse
of power, is liable to an action from the parties

<div class="sidenote">Laws with
reference
to pilots.</div>

<p>Although Congress possesses the power to make
the laws necessary for the regulation of <i>Pilots</i>, and
the whole business of pilotage is within its authority,
there is no general law for these purposes, and the
superintendence of pilots is left to the legislation of
the individual States. By the <i>Act of 7 August, 1789</i>,
it was enacted that all pilots in the bays, inlets,
rivers, harbours, and ports of the United States
should continue to be regulated by the existing laws
of the States respectively, until further legislative
proceeding by Congress. The licensing of pilots and
fixing rates of pilotage were therefore thus arranged
at first; but, as some difficulties arose, it was enacted
by the Act 2 March, 1837, that it was lawful for the
master or commander of any vessel coming into, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
going out of, any port situate upon waters forming
the boundaries of any two States to employ any duly
licensed or authorised pilot of either State.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of American
seamen,
especially,
of the New
Englanders.</div>

<p>The native-born American seamen are bold, adventurous,
and brave. In their merchant vessels the
proportion of native seamen is estimated at about
one-third, while it was a common remark that “the
rest are rascally Spaniards, surly John Bulls, Zealanders,
Malays, anything of any country.” The
American native-born seaman is frequently promoted
to be an officer, and, sometimes, to the command of
large ships, but there are perpetual complaints that the
people of the United States do not “take to the
sea” with alacrity. Indeed, it is only in the New
England States that the sailor’s life may be said to
belong to the soil itself, and even the natives of
that comparatively barren soil and rigorous climate
become sailors, perhaps less from love of adventure
and from their natural hardiness, than from necessity.
When boys they had, perhaps, widowed mothers to
support, younger brothers and sisters to care for,
and, there being no other congenial occupation, they
“go to sea.” When complaining of his “dog’s life,”
the American sailor sits by the hour whittling a
stick, and building little boats for his child, recounting
at the same time the perils and hardships of the
sea. Like British seamen, he has always his pet ship,
in which most of his experience has been acquired,
and the name of that ship is oftenest on his lips. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
is associated with the story of his loves, with the
memory of his friendships, and he dates all eras
from his several voyages in the vessel of the “one
loved name.” As New England was the great storehouse
of American seamen, there the best specimens
of their seafaring population were to be found. We
have seen, even in our time, the puritanical, weather-beaten,
Boston skipper—once so famous—sharp as a
north-easter, dressed in knee-breeches and buckles,
with a three-cornered cocked-hat, not forgetting the
pigtail, the very personification of our Commodore
Trunnion and Piper of a century ago. But, though
they may have degenerated since then, the seamen
engaged in the deep-sea fisheries are still a remarkably
hardy, robust race, and, hence, have succeeded
in that branch of maritime enterprise far more than
our own adventurers of late years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stephen

the rich
and
eccentric
American
shipowner.</div>

<p>Though altogether unlike Mr. Russell and the other shipowners
and merchants of Boston I have just named, I cannot omit to mention,
in connexion with the early history of the Merchant Shipping of the
United States, the name of Stephen Girard, one of the most prosperous
and eccentric of men, who was long known as the “rich shipowner
and banker of Philadelphia.” Born near Bordeaux, in 1750, of obscure
parents, he, at the age of ten or twelve years, embarked as a cabin boy,
with only a very limited knowledge of the elements of reading and
writing, on a vessel bound for the West Indies. Thence he sailed in
the service of an American shipmaster, to whom he had engaged
himself, as an apprentice, for New York. He soon rose to be mate and
master, and, after making a little money, he opened a small store in
Philadelphia, and also carried on a shipping business with New
Orleans and St. Domingo. At the latter place a tragical circumstance
occurred strongly illustrative of the troubles of the time, but which
contributed materially to swell Girard’s fortune. It chanced that at
the moment of the insurrection of St. Domingo, Girard had two vessels
lying near the wharf in one of the ports of that island. On the sudden
outbreak, the planters, instinctively rushed to the harbour and deposited
their most valuable treasures in the ships then there for the
purpose of safety; but returned themselves in order to collect more
property. As the greater part of them were massacred, few remained
to claim the property, and as a large portion of it had been deposited
in Girard’s vessels, for which no claims were made, he thus became
its owner. In 1791 he commenced building a class of beautiful ships,
long the pride of Philadelphia, for the trade with Calcutta and China—their
names, however,—the <i>Montesquieu</i>, <i>Helvetius</i>, <i>Voltaire</i>, and <i>Rousseau</i>—too
conspicuously reveal the religious dogmas of their owner.
By judicious and successful operations in banking, combined with
shipowning, Girard made so large a fortune that, in 1813, he was considered
the wealthiest trader in the United States. It is told of him
that when, in that year, one of his vessels with a cargo consisting of
teas, nankeens, and silks from China, was seized on entering the
Delaware, he ransomed her from the captors on the spot by a payment
of $93,000, paid in doubloons, and by this transaction added half a million
of dollars to his fortune! But Girard, with all his wealth, ended
his career without a friend or relative to soothe his declining years and
close his eyes in death. His legacies were large and numerous, while
the largest of them were characteristic of the man. Among these may
be named his bequest of 208,000 acres of land and thirty slaves to
the city of New Orleans, and other large tracts of land in Louisiana
to the Corporation of Philadelphia. To the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania he gave $30,000 for internal improvements; but the
most extraordinary of his bequests was $2,000,000, which he left
for the erection of an orphan college at Philadelphia—a magnificent
building—and the endowment of suitable instructors, requiring and
enjoining, however, by his will, “that no ecclesiastic, missionary, or
minister of any sect whatsoever shall ever hold or exercise any station
or duty whatever in the said college; nor shall any such person ever
be admitted for any purpose, or as a visitor, within the premises
appropriated to the purposes of the said college.” Such was Stephen
Girard, master and mariner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity
of proper
education
for merchant
seamen.</div>

<p>Although it can scarcely be said that the character
of British seamen degenerated from the time America
declared her independence till towards the close of
the first half of the present century, there is no
doubt that those of other nations were making
rapid strides in advance of them. Indeed, many
causes had combined to raise, alike, the position of
the shipowners and seamen of foreign nations, not
the least of these being the protection afforded to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
shipowners by the Navigation Laws, as under that
protective system they felt it less necessary to exert
themselves to contend with the foreigner as keenly
as, under other circumstances, they would surely have
done. Most foreign nations had also directed their
attention, long before we did, to the necessity of
thorough education for their seafaring population—a
policy they have since maintained. With that object
in view, schools were established at all their principal
seaports, where not merely the rudiments of
navigation were taught the youths, but considerable
attention was also devoted to their moral and intellectual
improvement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Practice in
Denmark.</div>

<p>In Denmark, for instance, the system of education
for the higher grades of the merchant service was
particularly strict and effective. No Danish subject
was allowed to act as master of a merchant vessel
unless he had previously made two voyages in the
capacity of mate, while the mates themselves had,
and still have, to submit to a general examination,
embracing (1st) a knowledge of dead-reckoning, the
nature and use of logarithms, and the first rudiments
of geometry; (2nd) the nature and use of the compass
and log; and (3rd) the form and motions of the
earth, and the geographical lines projected on its
surface, so as to be able to determine the position of
different places. It was also expected that he should
understand the nature of Mercator’s charts, and the
mode of laying down the ship’s course on them,
together with such calculations as may be necessary
for this purpose. Expertness in keeping a journal,
in the use of the quadrant, and in making the necessary
allowances for currents, lee-way, and the variations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
of the compass, were all required, together with
some idea of the daily motion of the celestial bodies,
of the sun’s proper motion, and the meaning of the
words “horizon,” “refraction,” “semi-diameter,”
“radius,” and “parallax.” He was also required to
know how to use the instruments for calculating the
elevation of the sun and stars, and the distance
between objects on shore! Nor, indeed, was his examination
limited to the more ordinary details of a
navigator’s duty. He was expected to be expert in
ascertaining what star enters the meridian at a given
time at the highest and the lowest elevations, as well
as in finding the latitude, both by means of the meridian
height of the sun or of a star, and in determining
the time for high and low water. He was
further expected to understand the mode of calculating
the time of sunrise and sunset, and of ascertaining
the variations of the compass by means of one
or more bearings in the horizon, and by the azimuth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In Norway
and
Sweden.</div>

<p>In Norway and Sweden, mates of ships had to
undergo a similar examination before being allowed
to act in that capacity, and a still more rigid examination
both as regards seamanship, navigation, and the
general knowledge of business relating to shipping
affairs, before they could command a vessel, together
with a knowledge of the Customs and Navigation
Laws, and of the usual averages and exchange. They
had likewise to know something of the elements of
shipbuilding, and of the mode of measuring a ship’s
capacity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Russia and
Prussia.</div>

<p>In Russia and Prussia the mates and masters of
merchant vessels, besides the qualifications above referred
to, were required not merely to read and write<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
their own language with accuracy, but to have some
knowledge also of English and French.</p>

<p>So early as 1806 a school was founded in Nicolaieff
to train masters and pilots for the commercial marine,
which, in 1832, was enlarged and removed to
Cherson, while another and similar establishment was
at the same time founded in St. Petersburg. All
coasting vessels are now bound to have masters who
have left these schools with certificates of competency.
But the most important measure for the
encouragement of seamen in Russia, whether employed
in river or sea navigation, was enacted in
1826; families devoted to navigation being then for
the first time incorporated in certain towns along the
sea coasts and great rivers under the designation of
“Corporations of Free Mariners.” These corporations
were exempted from the capitation and land
taxes, and from the conscription and quartering of
troops, on condition that they sent their young men
to serve for five years as apprentices in the Imperial
fleet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">France.</div>

<p>The system, however, of combining the services of
seamen for the navy and the mercantile marine alike
has been more thoroughly organised in France than
in any other country. There the State and Commercial
Navy are under the same code of regulations,
the members of each being equally entitled to
a pension after a certain length of service: in fact,
all seamen in France are held to be in Government
employ; their names are registered in the office of
the Marine Commissioners of the port to which they
belong, and, from the age of eighteen to fifty, they
are liable to be ordered at any time on board a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Government ship, to serve as long as necessary.
Hence it is that almost every seaman or fisherman
of France has served in the navy for at least three
years. At the age of fifty, and on the completion
of a service at sea of three hundred months in
either the navy or the merchant marine, a seaman
receives a pension according to a certain scale,
whereby, however, he cannot get more than six
hundred francs, or less than ninety-six francs per
annum. But these pensions are not really paid by
the State, as a deduction of three per cent. is made
from the monthly pay of every seaman in either
service, so as to provide a fund for their payment.</p>

<p>France also provides for her seafaring classes
more liberal and effective means of education than
are, perhaps, to be found in any other country. A
professor, paid by Government, resides in each of its
principal ports, who affords to all, seeking to be
commanders in the merchant service, instruction,
free of charge, on the different subjects connected
with their profession.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Remarkable
care
of seamen
in Venice;
Scuola di
San
Nicolo.</div>

<p>Seaman’s funds, somewhat similar to those in
France, have been established by all other European
nations, though the objects in view have differed.
That in England, well known as the Merchant
Seaman’s Fund, was instituted during the early part
of the present century, for the benefit solely of
merchant seamen, who were not under any obligation
to serve in ships of war, though, during the
great war, they were too frequently pressed into
the service. All these associations appear to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>had their origin with the Italian Republics, and that
of Venice is of considerable historical importance,
forming as it did the basis on which nearly all the
others have been engrafted. This institution, called
the <i>Scuola di San Nicolo</i>, was originally founded at
that city in the year 1476, in commemoration of the
successful defence of Scutari by the Venetians against
the Turks. Greenwich Hospital, in some respects,
resembles it, but the Venetian institution had attached
to it a Merchant Seaman’s Fund, distinctly
intended for the relief of the old and infirm sailors
of that service. The building itself was destroyed
in 1806, but the institution still survives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of this
institution;</div>

<p>In 1786, the laws relating to this excellent institution
having been carefully revised, required that all
seamen, whether Venetians or foreigners, as a condition
of their employment in the Venetian merchant
service, should inscribe their names at the Scuola di
San Nicolo. Foreigners domiciled, who had been
employed in the sea service of Venice for the space
of five years, were also entitled to the benefits of the
institution to the same extent as natives.</p>

<p>On the first inscription, each man had to pay three
Venetian livres and two soldi (about 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>) as
entrance money, and, subsequently, an annual contribution
of one livre and eleven soldi (1<i>s.</i> 1½<i>d.</i>). In
addition to the above, every sailor or other person
of the crew of a vessel was bound to pay twenty soldi
(10<i>d.</i>) for each voyage out and home.</p>

<p>All who had been inscribed two years, and had
punctually paid their contributions, were entitled to
the benefits of the institution, that is, to medical
attendance and lodging in the Hospital of Invalids,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
when advanced in years or infirm. Children, it
would seem, were only eligible in cases where the
fathers had sailed for ten years beyond the limits of
the Gulf of Venice, or along the Dalmatian coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and
general
working.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Variously
modified
since first
creation.</div>

<p>The “Scuola di San Nicolo,” as above described,
was preserved with all its laws and rules during the
first occupation of the Austrians, from 1797 to 1806,
after which it was suppressed by the then Government
of Italy. An invalid fund was then established,
which may be called an institution for the relief of
invalid sailors. One-sixtieth was deducted from all
payments made on account of the navy, and assigned
to it; it thus becoming, in reality, a military institution,
under the protection of the Royal Navy. Subsequently
additional funds were assigned to it, in the
shape of a percentage on all prizes, the proportion
given depending on whether the prize or its captor
were a ship of war, a privateer, or a merchant vessel.</p>

<p>By a decree of 1811, the endowment of the institution
was further augmented, and the means of giving
relief were consequently increased. Three per cent.,
instead of one-sixtieth, was granted out of the pay
of the Royal Navy; and merchant seamen were
likewise obliged to contribute their respective shares
of pay or prize money. Finally, in addition to the
percentage on prizes, the following casual sources of
emolument were set aside for this institution:—The
proceeds of wrecked vessels, if not claimed within a
certain time; the pay due to sailors or others, who
had deserted from vessels in the service of the State;
half of the pay due to deserters from the merchant
service; and the amount due on account of pay,
prize-money, &amp;c., to sailors or others dying at sea, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
not claimed within a certain time. The immediate
direction of the establishment was vested in the
Comptroller of the Marine, under the supervision of
the Royal Navy Board.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State since
1814.</div>

<p>After the return of the Austrian government in
1814, the civil and military establishment and their
administration were separated. Invalid sailors of the
navy were placed on the same footing as soldiers, and
the institution was then kept up and applied solely to
the benefit of the commercial marine, under the title
of “The Charitable Institution for Invalids of the
Venetian Commercial Navy.” The administration of
this establishment was vested in the office of Captain
of the Port, under the control of the Government.</p>

<p>Merchant seamen sailing in vessels entered on the
registers of the Venetian provinces contribute to its
support at the rate of three per cent. on their pay,
whether captains, officers, or men; this sum to be
paid at the office of the Captain of the Port by the
captain or owner of the vessel, according to the
muster-roll of the crew. Instead of the casual sources
of revenue granted by the decree of 1811, above
quoted, this institution is now endowed, in lieu of
the moiety of the unclaimed pay of deserters from the
merchant service, with an equivalent sum together
with the amount of all fines levied on seafaring persons
for infringement of the naval laws and regulations.
The capital thus accruing is invested in the
public funds, and the interest applied to the relief
of the deserving, according to the following scale:—Captain,
one Austrian livre (about 8<i>d.</i> sterling) daily;
an officer, eighty centimes daily; and a sailor, about
seventy centimes daily; their widows receiving respectively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
one-half the above sums. In making selections
from the candidates for relief, regard is had to
the most aged and infirm. There is no building now
appropriated for the reception of the aged and infirm,
but the sick are admitted, on application, to the Civil
Hospital in Venice. Orphan children are not entitled
under the rules to relief: indeed these regulations,
like others of a similar character, seem but provisional;
but, as they embrace the general features
of the Austrian and French systems, they merit
attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Qualifications
of
Venetian
shipmasters.</div>

<p>The law of the Venetian Republic of 1786, relative
to the merchant service, shows the pains taken in
former times by the Republic to secure efficient and
well-educated men for the command of their merchant
vessels. It may be inferred that no conditions were
imposed on persons desirous of commanding merchant
vessels previously to this law, as, by one of
its provisions, it was not to affect persons then in
employment as captains or masters—a principle
adopted by Great Britain in her recent Mercantile
Marine Acts. Those desirous of becoming captains
or masters were required to prove that they were
Venetian subjects; or if foreigners, that they had
been naturalised and had resided in the State without
intermission, or had been employed in the Venetian
sea service for fifteen years. In addition to
this it was requisite for the candidates to give proof
of being at least twenty-four years of age; of having
served at sea for eight years, either in a private ship
or in one belonging to the State, before they could
command a ship. Every one, too, besides being able
to read and write, was required to satisfy competent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
examiners that he was versed in the theory and
practice of navigation. A Venetian subject, having
an interest or share in a vessel and being duly
qualified, was, however, entitled to command in
preference to any other master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Present
regulations
of
Austria.</div>

<p>The Austrians, following the example of their provinces,
now require candidates for the command of
merchant vessels to show that they are twenty-one
years of age, and are domiciled in the Austrian dominions:
that they have served not less than five
years in national vessels other than coasting vessels,
and that their general conduct has been good. They
are required to undergo a severe examination before
a commission, consisting of the officer of government
charged with the affairs of navigation and trade, the
Professor of mathematics in the Naval College, the
Captain of the port, one member of the Chamber of
Commerce, and two experienced merchant captains.
Candidates are required to answer theoretical and
practical nautical questions; to solve such problems
as are set before them, and show that they are acquainted
with naval laws and discipline, before they
can take the command of merchant ships.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great
Britain.</div>

<p>Strange to say, Great Britain, the greatest of all
maritime nations, has only, at a comparatively recent
period, established a system, to which I shall hereafter
refer, whereby all masters and mates in her
service are now required to undergo an examination:
unlike France, however, she still leaves whatever
may be the expense of gaining the previous and
fundamental knowledge to be borne by themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Need of a
public
institution
for
merchant
seamen.</div>

<p>It would weary my readers were I to give further
details of the different modes established in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
nations for securing the due qualifications of masters
and seamen, or for providing institutions for their
benefit in sickness and old age. With the exception
of Greenwich Hospital, created for the benefit of
seamen serving in the Royal Navy, England possesses
no State institution appropriated exclusively for the
education of our merchant seamen, or for their benefit
in sickness or old age. The Merchant Seaman’s
Fund was abolished<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> in 1851; and I know of no
institution in this country where the aged seaman
can find refuge, except one which was recently established,
and is maintained by voluntary subscriptions.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
There are, of course, numerous charitable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>institutions—far more than in any other country—where
seamen, as well as all other classes of the
community, are to some extent provided for. But it
is to be regretted that, when the Merchant Seaman’s
Fund was abolished, some great institution, under the
authority of the State, to be supported mainly by
the seamen, as well as by voluntary contributions
and otherwise, was not then attempted for their
special use, so as to afford them some certainty that
they would receive either outdoor or indoor relief
(the former is preferable) when no longer able to
provide for themselves.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Institution
in
Norway.</div>

<p>One of the best of these institutions was formed in
Norway, in conformity with the royal rescript of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
23rd December, 1834. It is maintained, by voluntary
contributions from seamen and others, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
penalties arising from offences of seamen, and, in
some measure, by Government aid. The claimants
on this society are those seamen who, while employed,
contribute regularly to its funds. Its affairs
are managed by directors consisting chiefly of shipmasters.
Seamen who, on foreign voyages, leave
their vessels without permission of the master, lose
any rights they may have acquired; while such of
them as are entitled to claim, or their relicts, must
prove to the satisfaction of the directors that they
stand in need of aid. Shipwrecked seamen also
receive aid from this society.</p>

<p>Institutions like these, combined with the course of
examination required from all men holding responsible
positions on board ship, tend materially to
improve the condition of foreign seamen, and to give
them advantages too long withheld from the British.
These advantages, combined with the unwise protection
afforded by the Navigation Laws to the shipowners
and seamen of Great Britain, gave foreign
nations, for a time, a decided superiority over them.
Indeed, it was found that during the first half of the
present century neither the ships nor their crews kept
pace with those of other maritime nations, till at
length it became <i>necessary</i> to adopt measures, not
merely for the improvement of the condition of our
ships, but likewise for raising our seafaring population,
by means of a sound education, to such a
position as would enable them to compete successfully
under all circumstances with the ships and seamen
of other states.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign
Office circular
of
July 1,
1843.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Its value,
though
unfair and
one-sided.</div>

<p>With that important object in view, the English
Foreign Office issued a circular on the 1st July,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
1843, to all our consuls abroad, requesting information
respecting the conduct and character of British
shipmasters and seamen frequenting foreign ports;
the replies to which produced a large mass of valuable
information, presented to Parliament in 1848.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> But
this information would have been still more valuable
had it been obtained in a less one-sided and invidious
manner. “I am particularly desirous,” remarks the
writer of the circular, Mr. James Murray, “of gaining
information in regard to instances which have
come under your observation of the <i>incompetency of
British shipmasters to manage their vessels and their
crews</i>, whether arising from deficiency of knowledge
of practical navigation and seamanship, or of moral
character, particularly want of sobriety.... My
object is to show the necessity for more authoritative
steps on the part of Her Majesty’s Government
to remedy what appears to be an evil, detrimental
to, and seriously affecting the character of, our
commercial marine, and therefore advantageous to
foreign rivals, whose merchant vessels are said to be
exceedingly well manned and navigated.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Replies to
circular.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Consul
Booker.</div>

<p>With this assumption, that British ships and seamen
did exhibit the inferiority suggested by the
writer of the circular, it was but natural that the
answers to it should, as a rule, be in conformity with
the prejudged and premature opinions expressed in
it. Voluminous documents poured in from the different
consulates, and, certainly, some of them contained
charges of the gravest character against the
owners and crews of our merchant fleet. The first is
a letter (11th July, 1843) from Vice-Consul Booker,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>at Cronstadt, who seems to have ransacked his
archives, containing, as these did, the results of an
experience of fifty-nine years—to discover materials
whereon he could ground a charge against the British
sailors; but, while admitting that drunkenness was
their principal failing, and that it was “a rare circumstance
that a master is unfit to clear his ship
either inwards or outwards,” he added: “It does
not happen above two or three times in the year, in
which case I get hold of the mate, and no stoppage
ensues; and, in the intermediate time, when the
ship is loading, the master, if the worse for liquor,
avoids the office.” Of the seamen he remarked:
“The crews behave like too many common Englishmen;
take their glass freely when they can get it,
and sell or pawn their clothes when they have no
money; get into scrapes on a Sunday night, and
are brought before me on a Monday, lectured, and
discharged.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Consul
Baker.</div>

<p>Consul Baker, of Riga, was more pointed in his
charges. He remarked: “I am sorry to state that, in
my opinion, the British commercial marine is at
present in a worse condition than that of any other
nation. Foreign shipmasters are generally a more
respectable and sober class of men than the British.
I have always been convinced that, while British
shipowners gain by the more economical manner in
which their vessels are navigated, they are great
losers from the serious delays occasioned, while on
the voyage, and discharging and taking in cargoes,
growing out of the incapacity of their shipmasters,
and their intemperate habits. I have had occasion
to remark, while consul in the United States, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
American vessels, in particular, will make three
voyages to two of a British vessel, in this way
having an immense advantage over their competitor;
and also from the superior education, and consequent
business habits, obtaining better freights and employment
for their vessels on foreign exchanges.”
He further remarked, that, in several instances, he
had been compelled, on the representations of the
consignees, to take from shipmasters the command
of their vessels in a foreign port, and to appoint
others for the return voyage; their constant state
of intoxication rendering them wholly “unfit to
carry on their duties.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Consul
Yeames.</div>

<p>Consul-General Yeames, writing from Odessa on
the 1st December, 1843, stated, that though in his
experience he had known many unexceptionable and
respectable persons in command of British vessels,
they, as a rule, fell very far below the character of
commanders of foreign vessels, more especially those
of Austria. He attributed this inferiority in a great
measure to the want of education and an absence of
discipline. “Some of these shipmasters,” he added,
“are shamefully illiterate, and are not qualified to
do justice to the interest of owners in common
transactions that occur in this port. There is, too,
an impression here (and certainly among all the
foreign merchants) that British shipmasters are indifferent
to the condition of their cargoes, and
careless of their preservation, which is prejudicial
at least to our interests in the carrying trade.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Consul
of
Dantzig.</div>

<p>Somewhat similar accounts were received from
Gottenburg, and numerous other ports. “Taken as
a whole,” remarked the consul at Dantzig, “there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
not—and I say it with regret—a more troublesome
and thoughtless set of men, to use the mildest term,
to be met with than British merchant-seamen. Only
very lately, a master left his vessel, which was loaded
with a valuable cargo and ready for sea, and was,
after several days’ search, found in a house of ill-fame;
his mate was very little better than himself;
and his people, following this example, a set of
drunkards.” He added, that occurrences nearly as
bad as these were by no means rare, and that a
Prussian vessel was sure to obtain a preference when
freights were remunerative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Consuls
of
Genoa,
Ancona,
and
Naples.</div>

<p>From the Mediterranean ports the accounts received
were hardly more favourable to the character
of British seamen. The consul at Genoa stated that
it was quite common for captains of vessels at that port
to take up their abode at a tavern; leaving the entire
charge of the vessel in the hands of an ignorant
mate, whose whole learning was not a whit superior
to that of a man before the mast, and whose quarrels
with the men or those among themselves were forced
upon the consul for adjustment. At Ancona, the
greater part of the masters who frequented the port
were considered by the consul there to be unequal to
the responsible trust imposed in them, not so much
from the want of nautical skill as of sobriety. Out
of the shipwrecks which had occurred during his
residence at that port, he considered one to have
arisen from incompetency, one from the inebriety of
the master, and one from causes beyond control. At
Naples, the consul spoke of the masters of British
vessels being, on the average, ignorant and uneducated—“little
superior in mental or literary acquirements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
to the seamen they are placed over;” and
though, on the whole, good seamen, “few of them
understand navigation beyond the mere power of
keeping the ship’s reckoning. Nothing,” he added,
“could be more truly disgraceful or discreditable
than the manner of keeping the log-books of the
vessels that resort to this port.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Consul
Sherrard.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Consul
MacTavish.</div>

<p>From Trieste, Constantinople, and Alexandria, reports
nearly the same were sent in. Nor were those
from our consuls resident in the United States of a
more favourable character. “It was but last week,”
remarked Mr. Sherrard, writing from Portland, 27th
July, 1843, “that I had occasion to take upon myself
the risk of sending back to New Brunswick a vessel,
whose master, after disposing of her cargo and
receiving the proceeds, squandered the whole in
liquor, leaving his crew without their wages and the
vessel without sea stores.” He mentioned, also, the
instance of another, a British barque, from England
for St. John’s, Newfoundland, which was boarded by
a revenue cutter, the whole crew, including master
and mate, being in a helpless state of intoxication,
and the vessel drifting about embayed in a dangerous
place near Mount Desert. From Baltimore
the consul, Mr. MacTavish, wrote that, with few exceptions,
“almost all the masters of English merchantmen
which have arrived here from British
ports in my time appear to me incompetent, arising
chiefly from inebriety; but, with regard to colonial
vessels, I am happy to say that my experience has
been the reverse of the foregoing; the temperance
principle is becoming very general on board of them,
and a manifest improvement is in progress from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
that cause;” he added, in reply to questions about
the conduct of masters of Hanseatic ships frequenting
Baltimore, that, in his thirteen years’ experience, he
had heard of but one master of a vessel being a
drunkard, and he was at once removed. “They are,”
he said, “invariably competent navigators and good
scholars, many of them belonging to respectable
families in Bremen; and most abstemious, the principal
beverage used in the cabin being light-bodied
claret and vin de grave.” Of the British shipmasters
frequenting Baltimore he wrote in very disparaging
terms, asserting them to be, in point of intelligence,
address, and conduct, greatly inferior to the shipmasters
of either Bremen or America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Consul
Hesketh.</div>

<p>Mr. Hesketh, writing from Rio de Janeiro, states
that, during an active service of more than thirty years
as consul at that port, he had experienced unwearied
trouble and much anxiety, in consequence of the intemperate
habits of the masters and crews of British
merchant vessels, and that cases were not uncommon
in which it had been found absolutely necessary to
take from on board all intoxicating liquors. With
regard to their competency in other respects, he said:
“I have come to the conclusion that British shipmasters
are frequently entrusted with commands on
voyages requiring more knowledge of the scientific
department of navigation than they possess;” he
added, however, that the masters of large or first-class
merchant vessels were generally fully competent
for their duties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reports
from the
Consuls in
South
America.</div>

<p>Similar reports came from the consuls of Bahia,
Pernambuco, and Paraguay; the consul at the last-named
port remarking, “shippers now give such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
decided preference to the merchant vessels of
Sweden, Denmark, Sardinia, Hamburg, and Austria,
that they are rapidly engrossing the carrying trade
of Brazil; and this alarming fact is attributed by the
most intelligent British merchants and shipmasters,
with whom I have conversed on the subject, to the
greater care taken by foreign masters, and enforced
by them on their crews, in the reception and stowage
of their cargoes, which they consequently deliver in
much better order than do British vessels, the
masters of which are in general said to be exceedingly
careless and inattentive in this respect,” an
opinion confirmed by Mr. Ellis in his despatch to
the Foreign Office from Rio, 10th December,
1842.</p>

<p>Although, for the reasons I have named, these
voluminous reports are not so impartial as they
otherwise might have been, had Mr. Murray, in his
circular-note, merely expressed his desire to ascertain
the facts without expressing any opinion of his
own, there is too much reason for believing that
the character of British ships and the conduct of
British crews were then greatly inferior to those
of other nations; hence Mr. Murray’s subsequent
memorandum of the 22nd November, 1847, contains
unquestionably many valuable suggestions for their
improvement, while his conclusions could hardly be
questioned when he stated:—</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
conclusions
of Mr.
Murray,
Nov. 22,
1847,</div>

<p>“1st. That the character of British shipping has
declined, and that the character of foreign shipping
has improved.</p>

<p>“2nd. That there was not sufficient control over
British shipmasters and seamen, either at home or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
abroad, while foreign vessels were subject to considerable
control.</p>

<p>“3rd. That there was no system of regular education
for the merchant service of Great Britain,
but that, in foreign countries, this matter was much
attended to.</p>

<p>“4th. That the sort of education which a British
subject receives, when training for the higher grades
of the merchant sea service, does not suffice to qualify
him to represent with advantage to the merchant by
whom he may be employed that merchant’s interest;
and that he may often neglect those interests and
the merchant not be aware of the fact.”</p>

<p>“What was wanted,” Mr. Murray continued, “was
not merely a study of navigation and seamanship,
but a thorough knowledge of ship’s husbandry, and
a thorough knowledge of stowage of cargo, of exchanges,
and other commercial information which
would qualify a master to act, if necessary, as the
representative of his employer in the character of
merchant; the commander of a ship being in law
considered the representative of the owners of the
property on board. It was further urged that a
merchant had no means of accurately ascertaining
the character and capability of shipmasters or of
seamen, and really depended for the safety of his
property upon his insurances.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">and suggestions
for
remedies</div>

<p>For these reasons, with a view to maintain the
supremacy of Great Britain in commercial navigation
and enterprise, Mr. Murray proposed to establish “<i>a
Board or Department of Commercial Marine</i>,” at the
same time pointing out that the want of such a
department was greatly felt in the preparation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
any new law, and still more so in the subsequent
process of acting upon it. Nine departments, he
explained, were concerned in the Merchant Sea Service
Laws; and there was no central board to point
out to each department how each could best act for
the success of the whole; each department being left
to look merely to those interests committed to its
charge, and to its own convenience. The Board of
Trade was indicated as the department to which
the community would naturally look with regard to
everything relating to commerce, whether at sea or
on shore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Board of
Trade
Commission,
May
17, 1847.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Its results.</div>

<p>Previously to the issue of Mr. Murray’s ‘Memorandum,’
that Board had, on the 17th May, 1847,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
announced the intention of Government to issue a
commission without delay to examine into certain
matters relating to the commercial marine. This
inquiry confirmed in all material respects the information
previously received by Mr. Murray. Indeed,
three only out of seventy-five reports from
consuls stated that the condition of British shipping
had improved rather than declined; and, in these
cases, it was shown that, from the nature of the
trade in which the vessels were engaged—the fruit
trade of Greece, and from the perishable character
of their cargoes—the greatest care had to be taken
in selecting the best ships.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that, as early as 1843,
when Mr. Murray issued his circular letter to the
consuls, and more especially in 1847, when Lord
Palmerston ordered further inquiry to be made by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>means of this commission, Government saw the time
was approaching when great changes would be demanded,
not merely with regard to the Navigation
Act, but likewise in the laws affecting our ships and
seamen; and that it would, ere long, be essential for
our own interests to follow the example set us by
foreigners in the education of our seamen, as well as
in the application of public tests to prove the competency
of the masters and officers of British merchant
vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shipowners
condemned
for the
character
of their
ships and
officers.</div>

<p>Strong objections were, however, raised by the
shipowners against any Government interference, on
the ground that it would be partial, and consequently
so far unjust, these objections being naturally
strengthened by the manner in which Mr. Murray
had set about the enquiry of 1843. It was, nevertheless,
but too evident that, however much British shipowners
might deprecate the assistance or interference
of Government, a large proportion of their ships
were commanded and navigated in a manner reflecting
discredit on our national intelligence, and
injurious to the interests of Great Britain; that the
persons placed in command of them were too frequently
unfit for their duties; and that, while many
of them were so habitually addicted to drunkenness
as to be altogether incompetent for their position,
not a few of them were almost without education.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Nor in too many instances were the ships much
better than their masters; and hence foreign vessels
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>were frequently chartered in preference to British,
not because, as ships, they were superior in quality,
but on account of the greater care foreign shipmasters
bestowed on the stowage and transport of their cargoes,
and from the fact that being generally educated,
sober, intelligent, and capable of commanding respect
and maintaining discipline, the seamen themselves
were consequently more orderly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Views of
Government.</div>

<p>For these and numerous other reasons, Government
naturally asked whether it was justifiable that
the lives of thousands of persons should be constantly
jeopardised, because shipowners had the
power of placing incompetent persons in charge of
their vessels; and whether it was proper for the
State to allow its seafaring population to be left in
ignorance and disorder, and exposed to the evil
example of illiterate and intemperate masters. Many
thoughtful men out of doors also began to enquire
if it was right that these men, by sheltering themselves
under the Navigation Laws, should be thus
allowed to encourage the growth and employment
of foreign in preference to British shipping, to the
injury of the national interests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity
of a
competent
Marine
Department.</div>

<p>Even had it not become apparent that the time
had arrived for great changes in the commercial policy
of England, the condition of our seamen and the state
altogether of our merchant service required the exclusive
attention of some such public department as
Mr. Murray had recommended. But such matters,
however important, being subsidiary to the question
of the Navigation Laws and their effect upon maritime
commerce, were left in abeyance till these had
been fully considered.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> The “Winding-up Act, 1851,” enacted that compulsory contributions
should cease from that date; that those who had paid up till
then, should have the option of continuing these payments, but those
seamen who had not contributed before 1851 should not be admitted.
Thus the fund was practically “abolished,” and is now only in operation
for the purpose, as the Act names, of “winding-up.” This well-intended
Institution had become hopelessly insolvent through the
grossest mismanagement. Its administration was vested in different
irresponsible bodies at the different ports, and while the Legislature
<i>compelled</i> contributions, it took no security for the just appropriation
of these funds, and no security for solvency! The Winding-up Act of
1851 transferred its affairs to the Board of Trade for the purpose
of paying all existing pensions, and to allow the then existing contributors
to continue their annual payment should they wish to do so.
It has cost the country upwards of 1,000,000<i>l.</i>, and will probably cost
500,000<i>l.</i> more before all claims have been satisfied. The pensions
granted by the Board of Trade until now (1875) have been 7528<i>l.</i> to
masters and seamen, and 14,972<i>l.</i> to widows and children.</p>

<p>The “Belvidere,” known as the “Royal Alfred Aged Seaman’s
Institution,” was established, soon after the abolition of the “Merchant
Seaman’s Fund,” mainly through the exertions of the late Mr.
William Phillipps, Mr. George Marshall, and other philanthropic
shipowners. The laudable object of this excellent institution is to
provide for the “relief of aged and worn out merchant seamen of the
United Kingdom.” It was started by a grant of 5000<i>l.</i> from the Shipwrecked
Mariners’ Society, and is now maintained entirely by legacies,
donations, and annual subscriptions from charitable persons. These
amounted, in 1874, to somewhere about 7600<i>l.</i>, though, out of this sum,
the annual subscriptions were only 1600<i>l.</i> Its inmates were then 105
decayed seamen, whose ages ranged from 63 to 85. There were, besides,
in that year 110 persons receiving from its funds 12<i>l.</i> per annum in
out-door pensions. The inmates are provided with comfortable cabins,
clothed, a good mess, and have every comfort, with pleasant grounds for
exercise, overlooking the River Thames. All their physical and spiritual
wants are well supplied; and, so far as its limited funds permit, it has
proved of great service, being well and economically managed. When
its claims on the public—I might say on the country—become better
known, its means of doing good will thus, I hope, be largely extended.
Indeed, the Board of Trade having now in hand upwards of 200,000<i>l.</i>,
arising from the unclaimed wages and effects of deceased merchant
seamen, from the surplus fees of the mercantile marine, and other
similar sources, the question suggests itself if a portion of these surplus
funds could not be appropriated to the benevolent purposes of the
Royal Alfred Aged Seaman’s Institution?</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> In 1859, when a member of the Royal Commission on manning the
Royal Navy, I proposed to my colleagues the establishment of a merchant
seamen’s fund, under Government supervision, as a means of
raising a large portion of the reserves of seamen we were then considering.
Though my views on this and other points were not adopted,
they were published by order of the House of Commons, and accompanied
the report; and as the question is still one of much public importance
and still requires solution, I furnish extracts from these
“remarks”:—</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Williams,
observations
by, on the
advantage
of general
Seaman’s
Fund.</div>

<p>“‘Experience has shown,’ says Mr. H. R. Williams, of the Board
of Trade, in his sensible paper on the subject, ‘that any attempt to
establish a merchant seamen’s fund upon the principle of voluntary
payments would not be supported by a large body of seamen. The
working of the Seamen’s Fund Winding-up Act has proved that seamen
generally, whatever advantages may be offered to them, will not
voluntarily contribute to a fund. However great may be the objections,
therefore, to compulsory payments, there is no probability that a
fund can be established with any chance of success upon any other
principle.’</p>

<p>“I admit that there is something repugnant to the feelings of the
sailor, and, in fact, to all Englishmen, in the word ‘compulsory,’
when applied to the management of his own affairs; but, in general
practice, that which would be termed compulsion, if sanctioned and
regulated by the Legislature, is already a voluntary act cheerfully
undertaken by large masses of the people. There is scarcely a handicraft
trade in the kingdom the members of which have not formed
themselves into a society, the object of which is, by means of periodical
subscriptions, to secure a pension or payment in sickness or old age.
Both individually and nationally, every such institution is in the
highest degree commendable. If, therefore, these benefit societies
deserve encouragement and support, when formed for artisans and
others whose occupations are on shore, they merit encouragement and
support still more when their object is to relieve those whose occupation
is at sea. Seamen have no means of forming such associations, as
they are scattered over the whole world, having no organization, no
central power, and no machinery to put such a system into operation.
Whatever incentives they may have to combine together for such a
purpose, they have not the means of carrying into effect their wishes.
This appears to be generally conceded; and we have arrived at the conclusion
that it is the duty of Government to step forward to aid those
who, from their peculiar calling, are incapable of acting themselves.</p>

<p>“Commander Brown, the Registrar, Mr. Baker and Mr. Williams, of
the Board of Trade, together with Captain Pierce, of the Liverpool
Sailors’ Home, all concur in the opinion that the time has arrived when
a new seamen’s fund should be established on sound principles under
Government supervision, and upon such a basis as shall offer to the
seaman a strong and powerful inducement to preserve that test which
secures to him substantial maintenance in old age, or when prematurely
worn out. The whole of the machinery necessary to effect this
object is now established at the shipping offices, and in the existing
departments of the Board of Trade, and already in operation upon
12,000 masters and seamen who have contributed to the fund under
the Winding-up Act of 1851.</p>

<p>“... I am of opinion that such an institution would be highly
popular, even with the shipping interest. I say this, with the knowledge
that a seaman may calculate his wages at only 2<i>l.</i> 9<i>s.</i> instead of
2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per month; and with the possibility, that the difference of 1<i>s.</i>
per month may fall upon the shipowner, to which class I belong. But
if the incidence of this extra shilling should, in point of fact, fall
absolutely upon the shipowners, they would be gainers thereby, as it
is of the highest importance to them that the seaman should have
some substantial tie to bind him to this country. At present no such
tie exists. The British-born seamen become citizens of the world, and
find themselves quite as much at home in the United States as in their
native country. The higher rate of wages paid in the American ships
presents a temptation to them to enter that service in preference to
that of England. Now if some special inducement were offered to
them to remain at home, it would operate to diminish the number of
British seamen in the service of foreign states. The sailor would thus
have also ‘his stake in the public hedge.’ At present, the exceptional
use of savings banks furnishes almost the only link, for the beneficial
use of money-order offices, however great their advantages, is rather a
ready facility given than a permanent benefit enjoyed.</p>

<p>“With those views, I should propose to make a seamen’s fund the
basis of raising the remaining 18,000 men for a reserve. I think that
the fund should be a general one, to which both seamen in the Royal
Navy and in the mercantile marine should be called upon to subscribe.
I think it would be desirable to break through the line of demarcation
which has so long existed between the two services, and this would be
one step towards effecting that object. I would give seamen of all
classes a common interest in this one great fund, which might be
designated as National.</p>

<p>“I am aware that objections will be raised to any compulsory
fund. I would much prefer to have it a voluntary one; but knowing
the character of the seamen as I do, I am thoroughly convinced
that any fund established even under the auspices and with the
guarantee of the Government, on the voluntary principle, would be
a failure.</p>

<p>“... So far as the nation was concerned, the salutary effects of
such a fund would operate in three different ways: it would prevent
the seamen from being objects of charity or claimants upon the poor
rates during their old age; it would be a permanent tie to bind them
to their native country, founded upon a common bond of self-interest;
while it would form the groundwork of a system whereby the reserve
of 18,000, still wanting, might be raised.”</p>

<p>In proceeding to consider the great alterations in
the ancient commercial system of England which
have ultimately led to the entire abrogation of
the Navigation Laws, it is advisable to trace their
remarkable history under several distinct heads,
premising, however, that, previously to 1844, their
complete repeal had probably not suggested itself to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
any of the statesmen who, at various periods, had
held the chief power in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">High estimate
abroad of
English
Navigation
Laws.</div>

<p>For nearly two centuries an opinion had prevailed
in England, as well as in all foreign countries carrying
on maritime commerce, that the English Navigation
Laws, created originally to check, if not to
annihilate, the maritime power of Holland, had been
the means of raising Great Britain to her unquestioned
superiority on the ocean. But this opinion is best
answered by the fact that, long after the creation of
these laws, the Dutch still remained more powerful
at sea than any other nation;<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> while, on the other
hand, the shipping of England, under a different
policy, has become much more prosperous than it ever
was at any period during which the laws of Cromwell
were enforced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Change
necessary,</div>

<p>Other nations, however, could not fail to see that
English shipowners upheld these laws with much
tenacity; hence when, on the cessation of the wars
of Napoleon, they had more time to devote their
attention to individual pursuits, they asked themselves
two questions: (1st) if protective laws had
been beneficial to English ships, why should they
not follow the example of that country and enact
for themselves similar laws? and (2nd) if England
persisted in excluding their ships from her ports,
why should they not treat her vessels in the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>manner? In other words, they were already prepared
to act on the principle of retaliation, and adopt the
course pursued by the United States of America in
1817, when Congress passed a law, the counterpart, if
not the copy, of that in the English Statute-book,
which was adopted with the declared intention of
retaliating on Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">owing to
the Independence
of
America.</div>

<p>In the case of the American States, so long as they
were dependencies of the British Crown, their ships
could trade with all British dependencies on the
same footing as our own; but, when they became
independent, their ships, like those of any other
foreign Power, were excluded from every port where
our laws prohibited the entry of such vessels. Previously
they could freely trade with the British possessions
in America and with the West Indies, with
which they had hitherto carried on a profitable intercourse,
supplying them with lumber for their houses,
staves for their casks, corn, fish, and other provisions,
together with horses and cattle for their plantations,
besides affording our people there a sure market for
their surplus produce of coffee, sugar, and rum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
nations at
first Protectionist.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Pitt’s
proposals
with reference
to
trade with
America.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Pitt
resigns,
and a
temporary
Act
ensues.</div>

<p>Up to this period the practice of foreign nations
had not very materially complicated our navigation
system. If Great Britain, on her part, persisted in
refusing to receive, for instance, the produce of the
Spanish and Portuguese colonies in any but British
ships, Spain and Portugal, on their side, declined to
send their goods to England in any ships but their
own. So that our law in such cases, rigorous as it
was, did nothing but determine how a trade, in which
we had never had a share, must be carried on, should
we be permitted to enter it. But the case of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
United States was attended with much greater difficulty.
Here was an extensive and flourishing maritime
commerce, averaging nearly 3,500,000<i>l.</i> yearly,
which had hitherto been open to English and
American vessels, indifferently, but which was now,
by the operation of our Navigation Laws, confined
entirely to the former.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> It was then that the
strength and elasticity of our exclusive system were
first severely tested. Mr. Pitt foresaw this serious
difficulty so early as 1783 when Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and the necessity of immediately introducing
a temporary measure to regulate the commercial
intercourse with the now independent States
of North America. The Bill then actually introduced
by Mr. Pitt proposed to allow American
vessels to import into our colonies any articles whatever
of the growth, produce, or manufacture of the
United States, and to export any articles from our
colonies to the United States. But, unfortunately,
while this wise measure was under the consideration
of the House of Commons, the ministry to which
Mr. Pitt belonged resigned, and their successors, to
save themselves the trouble of passing a Bill of this
prudent and necessary character, passed a temporary
Act, afterwards renewed from time to time,
vesting in the Crown alone the power of regulating
the trade with America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The shipowners
and loyalists
in
America
successfully
resist
Mr. Pitt’s
scheme.</div>

<p>As might have been anticipated, considerable discussion
immediately arose with regard to the manner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>in which this power of the Crown should be exercised.
The West Indians, on the one hand, represented the
ruinous position in which they would be placed if
they were forbidden to trade with the United States:
while, on the other, the loyalists of the remaining
North American Colonies pleaded that they were
quite able to supply the people of the West Indies
with all they required, and prayed that the monopoly
the war had given them should not be abrogated.
These views were maintained by the shipowners of
Great Britain, on the plea that, if American vessels
were allowed to export West Indian produce, they
would convey it to foreign countries as well as to
the United States, thus securing a materially improved
position as carriers by sea; and, after this
case had been fully argued before the Board of
Trade, the shipowners and the loyalists unfortunately
won the day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Congress
the first to
retaliate.</div>

<p>Exasperated by such conduct, three of the American
States made a requisition to Congress to prohibit
all commercial intercourse with the British
colonies;<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and, before Congress met in 1789, no less
than nine of these States had demanded retaliatory
measures on British commerce and navigation. The
result was that two Acts of Congress were immediately
passed: one imposing a tonnage duty of six
cents on all American built and American owned
vessels, of thirty cents on vessels built in the United
States but owned by foreigners, and of forty cents
on foreign vessels; while the other imposed a tariff
of duties in the ordinary form, and provided for
the remission of 10 per cent. of such duties in case
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>the goods were imported in American ships. The
Americans thus paid us off in our own coin, and continued
this retaliatory system till 1817, when they
passed the Navigation Act to which I have just referred,
in all respects analogous to our own. Nor,
indeed, can there be any question but that they were
fully justified in these retaliatory measures. If one
nation insists on excluding the vessels of other
nations from their trade, they must naturally expect
that the legislators of the countries, whose vessels
are thus excluded, will take similar steps, even to
the injury of their own people; in fact, this is just
what England did when she prohibited her people
from obtaining from other countries, at the lowest
cost, the produce or manufactures essential for their
existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">These restrictions
injurious,
alike, to
England
and her
Colonies.</div>

<p>But besides this, these restrictive measures on the
part of Great Britain, had in more than one instance,
proved, in many other respects, most injurious to her
own people, while inflicting the greatest hardships
and most lamentable sufferings on her own West
Indian colonies. Thus, between 1780 and 1787 no less
than 15,000 slaves perished from starvation, having
been unable to obtain the requisite supplies of food
from the North American colonies at a period, when
the home-grown portion of their sustenance had
been destroyed by several hurricanes. Yet, notwithstanding
this terrible calamity, the British Parliament
persevered in the system it adopted, and
ultimately passed an Act (28 Geo. III., cap. 6)
whereby no goods could be imported into the West
Indies from the United States, even in British ships,
except about thirty enumerated articles, the produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
of these States. Indeed, the Act went so far as to
prohibit the importation of even these articles from
any of the <i>foreign</i> West Indian Islands, except in
cases of public emergency, when the governors of
individual colonies were allowed to relax this prohibition.
Similar laws were also passed to prohibit
the importation of goods into our North American
colonies from the United States, except for similar
reasons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commercial
treaties
with
America
between
1794 and
1817.</div>

<p>The injurious consequences of such policy, especially
in the provocation it gave to the Americans,
led to the conclusion, in 1794, of the treaty to
which I have already incidentally referred<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> (though,
strange to say, even this was disapproved of by
many persons in England), whereby American
vessels, not exceeding seventy tons burden, were
allowed admission into the British West Indies with
such articles of United States produce as were not
generally prohibited, and, at the same time, permitted
to export therefrom to the United States any
produce of the West Indies legally exportable thereto
in British vessels. Curiously enough, the following
proviso was appended to this clause:—“That this
liberty only extends to a direct intercourse between
the British West Indies and the ports of the United
States, and the United States engage to prohibit the
carriage of molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa, or cotton in
American vessels, either from his Majesty’s dominions
or from the United States to any other part of
the world.” The treaty also provided for placing
the trade between Great Britain and the United
States on a permanent footing, it having till then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>been regulated by Orders in Council. This treaty,
which gave even greater dissatisfaction in the
United States than in England, was not ratified by
Congress till 1796; nor was the Act for giving effect
to it in Great Britain passed till the following year.</p>

<p>This Act, however, made no provision for the
admission of American vessels generally into our
colonies. It simply provided that American ships
were at liberty to import into Great Britain such
produce of their own States as was admissible in
British vessels; it moreover imposed a tonnage duty
on the ships, and a discriminating duty on the
goods imported by them, in order to countervail
any duties levied on goods imported into the United
States by British ships. The provisions of the
treaty as to opening the trade of the West Indies
appear to have fallen to the ground. An additional
article to the treaty of 1794 stipulated that the article
containing those provisions shall be suspended; while
a later treaty (1806) contained a recital that the two
high contracting parties had been unable to arrange
the terms on which the commerce between the United
States and the West Indies was to be carried on. In
fact, they came to no definite arrangements till the
United States passed their retaliatory Acts in 1817
and 1820, and, even then, it took more than ten
years to settle the differences between them on
almost any one question. Indeed, the only alterations
of any importance made between 1806 and the
passing of the American Navigation Act, in 1817,
were the opening of the trade between the United
States and our North American colonies, in 1807,
and the conclusion of a treaty in 1815 abolishing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
differential duties levied by the two countries on
the ships of each other in respect of direct voyages
between them.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In 1808, and more fully in 1810, similar privileges
were granted to the Portuguese dominions in South
America; and, in 1822, these were extended to
all countries in America, being, or having been,
under the dominion of Spain. When the Customs
Laws were first consolidated in 1825, the exceptions
became the rule, and importations from Asia and
Africa were placed on a similar footing to those from
America. Thus our original rule as to importations
from Asia and Africa, as well as from America, was
broken down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Acts of
1822 and
1823, and
further
irritation
in
America.</div>

<p>Though the Act of 1822 allowed a considerable
number of articles to be imported into the free ports
of the West Indies from any foreign country in
America in ships of such country, it contained a
clause reserving to the King the power of prohibiting
such intercourse with any foreign country not
treating British shipping with equal favour. The
President of the United States, having been previously
empowered by Congress to open the ports of
that country to British vessels on the same terms
as were required from United States vessels when
coming from any British port in the West Indies,
passed on the 21st March, 1823, an Act to regulate
“the commercial intercourse between the United
States and certain British ports.” By this Act the
ports of the United States became open to British
vessels coming from the free ports of the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
North American and West Indian possessions, while
power was given to the President to remove the
differential duties levied on goods so imported, on
receiving information that similar privileges had
been conceded in such British colonial ports to the
vessels of the United States. The Act, however,
required all goods so imported to be the produce of
the colony whence they came and to have been
imported thence direct. It further enacted that
such British ships might take back produce of the
United States, provided they gave bonds to land
it directly at the port for which they cleared out.
As the provisions of this Act were, however, to
depend on the continuance of those enacted by
the British Legislature in 1822 (3rd Geo. IV.,
cap. 44), and, as the vessels of the United States
were not placed on precisely the same footing in
the ports of the West Indies as British ships, this
power of the President was never exercised, and a
British Order in Council in opposition to it was
subsequently issued on the 21st July, 1823. Here
again arose another war of tariffs, for this Order
levied countervailing duties on vessels of the United
States and their cargoes in the ports of the British
North American and West Indian possessions from
the ports in the United States to the extent of
4<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per ton, as well as a discriminating duty of
10 per cent. on imported articles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Order in
Council,
July, 1826.</div>

<p>In 1825, when the consolidation of the Customs
Laws was under consideration, as well as the extension
of treaties with other countries, negotiations
were again renewed with the United States, but they
were not successful, and another Order in Council<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
was issued on the 27th July, 1826, reciting that
the conditions laid down by the Possessions Act,
6 Geo. IV., cap. 114, had not been fulfilled, that is
to say, that the United States had not reciprocated
the privileges Great Britain had granted to American
ships, and that, therefore, the privileges possessed by
American vessels of importing the produce of their
country into British possessions abroad, and of exporting
the produce of those possessions to any
foreign country whatever, would cease on certain
dates fixed in the following year. As might have
been anticipated, the President issued, on the 17th
March, 1827, a proclamation prohibiting the trade
and intercourse with the British possessions authorised
by the Act of Congress of 1st March, 1823.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conciliatory
steps
of the
Americans,
1830.</div>

<p>Happily, however, these retaliatory measures did
not remain long in force; and, after various negotiations,
it was enacted by the American Congress on
the 29th May, 1830, that, whenever the President
should have evidence that Great Britain would open
the ports of her colonial possessions in the West
Indies, South America, and the Bermudas, for a limited
or indefinite time to United States ships, at the same
rate of impost and tonnage and with the same cargoes
as British vessels, and that they would be allowed to
export from such British possessions to any country
whatever any article which could be exported in
British vessels, leaving any other intercourse with
Great Britain in other respects as it then was, he
might grant similar privileges to British vessels
coming from the said possessions to the United
States. This conciliatory measure was followed on
October 5th, 1830, by a proclamation from the President,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
extending the provisions of the Act to the
British colonies therein specified, and which had
been opened to American vessels. Finally, a British
Order in Council of the 5th November of that year,
repealing the various Orders passed between 1823
and 1827, was issued, authorising vessels of the
United States to import into British possessions
abroad any produce of the United States from those
States, and to export goods from the British possessions
abroad to any foreign countries whatever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreigners
look with
suspicion
on any
change in
the Navigation
Laws.</div>

<p>Subsequently to the failure of Mr. Pitt’s measure
respecting the trade of the United States, no great
effort was made for many years to modify grievances
with other nations, which every one felt were caused
by the Navigation Laws. Protection had become
so thoroughly engrafted on the whole policy of the
nation, that the question of the repeal of these laws
could only be approached by degrees, the country
being so impressed with their necessity, that any
attempt during the first quarter of this century to
sweep them away would have proved a signal failure.
Indeed, at the close of the French war, when modifications
were offered, conditionally, to other countries,
it is not surprising that such foreign nations as
believed the prosperity of England to be due to
her protective system were not satisfied of the
honesty of her intentions: most of them, in fact,
looked with suspicion on proposals which, in the
dawn of sound commercial knowledge, were not unnaturally
thought by them inimical to the interests
of England. Foreign nations were slow to recognise
that the comparative freedom of her constitution,
her vast mineral resources, the skill and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
energy of her people, the security of property, and
the equality of taxation, could secure for England
either her commercial or her manufacturing superiority;
and, still less, could they comprehend how
much such causes as these had to do with her maritime
supremacy. They were equally unable to discover
to how great an extent the prosperity of
these interests and of shipping were mutually dependent
on each other, ships being really the adjuncts
only of commerce, as without it there would be no
reason for their existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reciprocity
Treaties of
1824-6.</div>

<p>But after much discussion reciprocity treaties were
concluded by Mr. Canning and Mr. Huskisson with
several Continental Powers, the object of these
statesmen being to hold out the right hand of fellowship
to other nations, and to surrender in exchange
for some concession on their part the more
stringent conditions of our Navigation Laws. The
earliest of these treaties was with Prussia, on the
2nd April, 1824: on the 16th June, we made another
with Denmark; on the 29th September, 1825, with
the Hanseatic Republics of Lubeck, Bremen, and
Hamburg; on the 16th January, 1826, with France,
and on the 26th December, of the same year,
with Mexico. Various other treaties followed;
opening, on certain terms of reciprocity, the ports
of Great Britain to the ships of the nations with
whom they were made; but reserving to her own
ships, as a rule and with jealous care, her colonial
ports.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of
treaties in
early
times,</div>

<p>During the Middle Ages, when foreigners were
too frequently subjected to unjust treatment, treaties
were, no doubt, necessary for their protection. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
instance, at one time, all foreigners residing in
England were held liable for the debts and even
for the crimes of each other. Shipwrecks, though
attended with less of the barbarity of earlier times,
were regarded in most countries as fortunate opportunities
for plunder; while tolls and local charges
of the most arbitrary description were levied on
aliens by states, princes, corporations, and the lords
of manors. There were also many other matters
scarcely less oppressive and unjust which could only
be redressed by negotiations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">but inadequate
for the
regulation
of commercial
intercourse,
and liable
to unfair
diplomacy.</div>

<p>Under such circumstances it was necessary for
commercial States to secure, by treaties, that protection
and security for the person and property of
their subjects abroad against the injustice they were
liable to, and which they could not obtain from the
laws of the countries where they might happen to
be. Treaties were also required for the regulation
of neutral commerce during war, and for defining
clearly what goods could not be carried by neutrals
for the belligerents. For all such purposes treaties
were, of course, essential; but, when they came to
be used, with the further object of teaching different
nations how to conduct their own business,
a practice arose which, however useful at the time
in assisting a change of system, could not long
endure. Regulations as to the duties chargeable
on certain articles, or for the privileges of certain
ships, according as they were built by, or belonged
to, particular countries, inducing constant misrepresentation
and tending to create grave differences
between nations, were soon found to be neither the
best nor the wisest means for producing economic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
or friendly commerce. Moreover, the whole system
of treaties so constructed was attended with a mode
of bargaining, in which the clever diplomatist might
frequently gain unfair advantages for the people he
represented. Such a course of action was so obviously
undignified in the conduct of national affairs, that all
merchants of high standing in different countries at
length protested against it. Statesmen, also, began
to discover that, as a rule, it was better for commerce
to flow on with no interference from treaties or other
legislation—that, as a matter of fact, it prospers best
unaided; and, further, that such a state of things,
while unsatisfactory so far as the intercourse between
nations is concerned, was also discreditable, alike to
the nations entertaining such propositions, and to the
ministers or officers by whom they were proposed.</p>

<p>As the whole of the treaties, with their numerous
protocols and appendices, their labyrinths of “clever
clauses” and mysterious paragraphs, have been published,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
and can be examined by those of my readers
who are interested in such diplomatic intricacies, it is
only necessary to give here the general purport of
them, as I shall have occasion to notice, hereafter, in
reviewing the progress of merchant shipping, those
more directly affecting that interest; but, that my
readers may understand more clearly the nature of
these treaties, I furnish the text of that with France.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
It gives the general conditions embodied in such
documents, and the extent of the concessions England
was prepared to make with those countries which
were willing to reciprocate with her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reciprocity
treaties
only,
partially,
of value,</div>

<p>The results of these “Reciprocity Treaties,” however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>as shown in the note,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> were, for the time,
satisfactory to both countries, in so far as they
materially tended to increase intercourse, while they,
certainly, proved advantageous, in the long run, to
the shipowners of England. But they were full of
inconsistencies, and, as the trade between nations
increased, it became simply impossible to carry them
out satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Nor was it, indeed, likely that people of different
nations, who had been thus far “educated” to the
advantages derivable from free intercourse, would
continue to endure the absurd clauses of treaties prohibiting
them from using corn, cotton, sugar, and
numerous other necessaries of life, piled in heaps
as these often were in their stores and warehouses,
merely because they had been imported in other
ships than those of Great Britain, or of the countries
where they had been produced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and do not
check the
anomalies
of Protection.</div>

<p>The fact was, that while these treaties did create
a sort of uniformity before unknown, and so far
increased the facilities of intercourse, they did not
obviate the most glaring hardships and inconveniences
of the previous system of protection. An
American vessel, for instance, might bring American
cotton to England direct; but if this cotton had been
landed at any foreign port, neither the ships of that
country nor of any other could have conveyed it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>thence to our shores; while the corn of Russia, if
landed in Prussia, or in the ports of any other nation,
was prohibited in England, however great might be
the demand for it at the time.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when it was first proposed in 1821
to allow British ships to import non-prohibited
articles from any part of the world, the proposal was,
for the time, effectually resisted by our shipowners,
on the plea that the cheaply built and navigated
vessels of other countries would carry the produce of
America and Asia into continental ports, and leave
to British ships only the small profit to be derived
from its conveyance across the English Channel!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Committee
of 1844-5
promoted
by the
Shipowners,
who seek
protection
against
Colonial
shipping.</div>

<p>But though it was abundantly clear that great
changes were necessary beyond the treaties which
had been effected (an enlightened class of merchants
and manufacturers having now arisen who required
that they should be entirely unfettered in the conduct
of their own affairs, and that they should be
at liberty to import and export whence, whither,
and how they pleased) it was no easy thing to induce
Government even to consider the advisability
of taking a further step in advance and repealing
laws so long in force. No important changes were,
therefore, contemplated until 1844, when a Committee
of the House of Commons was appointed to inquire
into the working of those treaties and the condition
of the commercial marine of the country:
indeed, the appointment of even this Committee appears
to have originated from complaints preferred
by our shipowners, as one of the duties imposed upon
it was the consideration of the best mode of encouraging
and extending the employment of British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
shipping. Curiously enough, the chief complaint of
the shipowners, in this instance, was against the privileges
granted to colonial-built ships, the owners of
which were, of course, on the same footing as those
of vessels built in the United Kingdom. It was
alleged that the latter, as costing a great deal more,
were unable to compete successfully with the less
costly ships of North America, and, therefore, legislative
protection was sought, on the ground that the
competition of these ships had materially lowered
the rates of freight.</p>

<p>The Committee of 1844 was appointed at the
instance of Mr. Lyall, a shipowner, and one of the
Members for London; and, although it sat during
the whole Session, it reported that, from unforeseen
circumstances, it had been prevented from going
fully into the matter, and requested re-appointment
in the following Session, which was acceded to. But,
as about this time, after a long period of depression,
prosperity returned to the shipping interest,
employment for ships having become better, while,
in many important trades, the rates of freight had
advanced, the inquiry by the Committee, under such
auspicious circumstances, was allowed to drop. It
was, however, plain enough from the temper of Parliament,
that no recurrence would be permitted to
anti-colonial protective measures.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reciprocity
must
lead to
free navigation.</div>

<p>The General Shipowners’ Society<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> attributed this
prosperity to the guano trade, which had recently
arisen on the coast of Africa; but other and <i>far</i>
more influential causes had been at work. The
treaties of reciprocity had, with all their imperfections,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>no doubt, tended materially to increase our
intercourse with foreign nations, while the admission
of their ships to our own ports, strange as it may
appear, had greatly increased the employment for
our own. Though our shipowners resolutely denied
that these measures had anything whatever to do
with the increased prosperity, more enlightened men
had arrived at entirely different conclusions, and
were convinced that the policy of reciprocity, however
unsatisfactory in many respects, was not merely
a step in the right direction, but was the best, and
perhaps then the only, mode of breaking down, bit
by bit, the huge fabric of protection, the growth of
more than two centuries: indeed, it was clear that
the “Great Maritime Charter of England,” as the
Act of Cromwell had been somewhat ostentatiously
denominated, could only be destroyed by degrees.
This vast tree, if it may be so described, had taken
too deep root in the soil of England to be overthrown
at one blow; and the Reciprocity Treaties
undoubtedly served as wedges for its destruction.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Sir Robert Peel had made
great changes in the Tariff. Commencing with the
coarser sorts of manufactures, he had relinquished all
duties on the importation of wool, linen, and cotton,
and had reduced the duties on the finer qualities
of the same goods from twenty to ten per cent.,
and on manufactured silks from thirty to fifteen
per cent., making equally important reductions in
the duties imposed on various other articles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New Class
of Statesmen,
well supported
by
the People
outside.</div>

<p>But a new class of men had now arisen to extend
the principles of Free-trade, and to force home the
wedges of unfettered commerce with heavier blows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
than Canning, Huskisson, or even Peel, had ever
done. The people, led in this instance by men from
among themselves, of the industrial classes; and,
guided by the voice of Wisdom, were now trumpet-tongued
proclaiming their rights and demanding
justice, on conditions which, however large, were
yet so unanswerable, that, before long, the proudest of
our aristocracy and the most exalted of our statesmen
paid their homage to the “unadorned eloquence”
resounding throughout the land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exertions
of Lord
John Russell,</div>

<p>Though Lord John Russell, an honest adherent
from his youth to the enlightened policy of Charles
James Fox, followed in their footsteps, and struggled
onwards amid innumerable difficulties, it was
impossible for him to force his way, almost alone
against the class to which he belonged, and through
the rank grass and tangled brushwood which surrounded
this huge old tree. Indeed, almost every
member of the ancient aristocracy except himself
was opposed to the course he had resolved to pursue;
and although the Parliamentary Reform Bill
of 1832 carried on his motion, and, in a great
measure, by his early and unwearied exertions, had
returned to the House of Commons many men ready
to render him every assistance, the power of that
House was still insufficient to effect, to anything like
the extent he had in view, the laudable and, indeed,
noble object of his ambition, a thoroughly unfettered
commerce. On the people, however, he could fully
rely: they were now inquiring more earnestly than
they had ever done how it was that the food necessary
for their existence was so heavily taxed, and why
they were not allowed to buy that food where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
pleased, and to import it on the most economical
terms. If their knowledge of geography, as they
were sometimes sneeringly told, extended no further
than what they had learned from the Sacred writings,
that grand old historical record taught them, that
Egypt produced grain at less cost and in far greater
abundance, than England; so great, indeed, that its
granaries had once supplied the wants of Rome and
of the Ancient World. When, therefore, they learned
that that grain could not be had, because a comparatively
small number of men—landowners and shipowners—who,
from their wealth, exercising great
influence in Parliament, were of opinion that the importation
of food from other and cheaper countries
meant ruin to them, the people, in mass, unequivocally
desired to know, in a more detailed and more
satisfactory manner than they had hitherto been
told, “<i>the reasons Why</i>.” The question they had
now asked, through their leaders, was one which demanded
an answer. First promulgated in the workshops
of Lancashire, it spread in all directions. It was
whispered in Belgravia; loudly proclaimed by the toiling
millions; talked about by the cottagers in every
valley and by the shepherds on every hillside; till, at
length, it was adopted, in the most earnest manner, by
the middle classes, the bone and sinew of Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">who leads
the way
against
Protection.</div>

<p>With such overwhelming aid, Lord Russell and his
exploring party were enabled to penetrate the dense
forest of protection, and reach the roots of the huge
and rank old tree, which not merely overshadowed
the rich soil of their native land, but spread its
branches over their seaports, so as to prevent the
importation from other lands of articles necessary for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
their existence. They saw that, under its shadow, no
herbs grew except such as, from their position, were
favoured by a ray of the hazy sunlight of protection;
healthy shrubs, luxuriant in their nature,
withered and decayed wherever its branches extended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard
Cobden
and the
Anti-Corn-Law
League</div>

<p>The chief of the new class of politicians, who had
arisen was no common man: he was one whose clear
judgment, while it embraced existing wants, penetrated
far into the future. Richard Cobden, the son
of a Sussex yeoman, and, practically, one of themselves,
who had been trained to commerce,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> saw perhaps
more clearly than any one else the pernicious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>effects of all protective laws. Supported by an
overwhelming array of facts, he arranged them in
a manner so clear, and made them known in so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
pleasing and homely a style of eloquence, as to command
attention and carry conviction to every man
who was open to reason. In a word, he was the first
to thoroughly convince the people of Great Britain
that they had a <i>right</i> to be allowed to purchase the
necessaries of life wherever they could obtain them,
and to dispose of their manufactures wherever they
could sell them, on the most advantageous terms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">John
Bright.</div>

<p>In directing the attention of the masses to this all-important
question he sought the aid of men who
had sprung from the people and had been trained
to commerce; and he found many able and truly
earnest colleagues, but none more so than John Bright,
a man of greater, though perhaps not more convincing
eloquence than his own, who like himself
had no object in view, as the whole experience of his
life has proved, than the good of his country. While
Cobden and Bright proclaimed, with overwhelming
force, the policy of Charles James Fox, which
Huskisson and Canning had first practically put
in operation, and which Lord John Russell was now
zealously pursuing in Parliament,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> an Association,
under their leadership, was being formed out of doors
destined to give the fullest freedom to commerce.
The first object of the Anti-Corn-Law League was to
lower the price of bread, which with every deficient
harvest approached a famine price, and thus enable
the working classes of every grade to compete with
greater prospects of success and to the best advantage,
in the production of those articles most in
demand in their own and other countries, and, at the
same time, to secure them more steady employment
and a higher rate of wages. With this object, its
members set themselves heartily to work, proclaiming
their views at public meetings in almost every
city and town in Great Britain, and, in the course of
their labours, making many converts to their policy
among the higher classes, among whom Charles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
Villiers ought to take high rank, for he was unwearied
in his exertions on behalf of the people.
Nor did they lack some associates among even the
shipowners of England, who, seeing that the free
importation of corn from other countries would afford
greatly increased employment for their ships, readily
joined the league. It is certain, however, that many
of this class did not at the time perceive that, though
the immediate object of the association was to cut
down the chief branch of the huge old tree of protection,
other branches, such as those interfering
with free navigation, must likewise be pulled down
as the supplement to free importation of corn: probably
they did not reflect that, should the Free-traders
abolish the protection then afforded to the
proprietors of land, a protective system for the maritime
interest alone could no longer be maintained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
the Irish
famine,
1845-6.</div>

<p>But an event happened which, although in itself
a grievous national misfortune, brought about, at an
earlier period than might otherwise have been the
case, the abolition of the Corn Laws, as well as the
suspension, for a time, of the Navigation Laws.
This calamity was the failure of the potato crop in Ireland
in 1845 by “a pestilence so minute that it eluded
the power of the finest microscope, so mysterious
that it defied the researches of the most searching
philosophy, but strong enough to overturn governments,
general enough to alter established commerce,
powerful enough to cause the migration of nations.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The whole crop of potatoes in Ireland having
been destroyed, the price of grain rose at one
bound from 45<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> to 60<i>s.</i> the quarter, and Cabinet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Councils assembled in November to consider the propriety
of throwing open the ports of the United
Kingdom. As the Cabinet was divided on the subject,
Sir Robert Peel, impressed with the dangers of
the approaching crisis, resigned office, and Lord
John Russell, whose celebrated letter on that occasion
must long be remembered, was called upon to
form a new Administration; but personal jealousy
among the Whigs<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>—a jealousy which lasted many
years—prevented the formation of a ministry by the
opposition party. Nor was Lord Stanley, who had
been a member of Sir Robert Peel’s Cabinet, more
successful in a similar attempt: hence, with the exception
of his Lordship, the members of that Cabinet
resumed their former places.</p>

<p>On the 4th December, 1845, it was intimated
through the ‘Times’ newspaper, which had for some
months previously avoided the question of total
repeal, that Sir Robert Peel would propose the
entire abolition of the Corn Laws. The Queen’s
speech, as well as the speech of Sir Robert Peel on
the Address, more distinctly announced the policy of
the reconstructed Administration, and, having called
attention to the measures of commercial reform
already adopted, which had tended so materially to
the greatness of this country and the welfare and
happiness of its inhabitants,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> he called on the agriculturists
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>to submit to some sacrifice on their part,
proposing a sliding-scale of duties on corn until
February 1849, with the condition, however, that
wheat and other cereal produce should, after that
date, be imported from foreign countries at a duty of
1<i>s.</i> a quarter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Robert
Peel carries
the
Repeal of

Laws, and

<p>It is not the province of this work to describe the
struggles of parties during this momentous period,
and it is therefore sufficient to state that the measures
of Sir Robert Peel, supported as they were out of
doors by the vigorous action of the Anti-Corn-Law
League, and in Parliament by the Liberal party,
were carried by large majorities through the Commons
and were, ultimately, passed by the Lords. But,
meantime the Irish Arms Bill had furnished the
Opposition with a temporary accession of members
to defeat that measure, and consequently with the
means of overthrowing Sir Robert’s Administration,
so that the night of his triumph on the great question
of the repeal of the Corn Laws was a witness
also of his downfall; and, in the records of the
debates of that ever-memorable evening, may be
read the words now so familiar to our ears:—“It
may be,” he remarked, in his concluding speech,
“that I shall be sometimes remembered with good-will
in those places which are the abodes of men
whose lot it is to labour and earn their daily bread
by the sweat of their brow; in such places, perhaps,
my name may be remembered with expressions of
good-will, when those who inhabit them recruit their
exhausted strength with abundant and untaxed food,
the sweeter because no longer leavened with the spirit
of injustice.”</p>

the pen of a ready writer, I prefer leaving these to be dealt with by his
biographer, when his executors consider that the time has arrived to
publish his life. But I think I ought not to withhold from my readers
the account he gave me of his commercial career, more especially as
an erroneous impression prevails in public that, though great as a
statesman, he was unsuccessful as a man of business. This letter
referred to the question of Limited Liability which we had frequently
discussed. It is written in his happiest style; and if I could to
advantage (but I cannot), I would not alter a single word. “It is
singular,” he remarks in another letter of his now before me, approving
of some comments I had made, “how much better we all write when
we are expressing ourselves with unrestrained freedom to a friend,
than when we are polishing off our sentences for the great public. I
find it always in my own case, and the reason is simply that we are
more <i>natural</i>, and therefore kindle a warmer sympathy in the breast
of the reader. It is this which makes the private memoirs and
correspondence of great men much more interesting than their public
performances.” For these reasons, I venture to give to the public the
letter he writes about himself and his business career unaltered, except
where I have omitted the names of two noble Lords still living.</p>

“Midhurst, 24th March, 1856.<br>
</p>

<p>
“<span class="smcap">My dear Lindsay</span>,     <br>
</p>

<p>“I can see no flaw in your indictment, and do not think there is
a shade of difference in our views upon partnership matters. But I
would rather talk than write to you on the subject. It has always
appeared to me that the fundamental fallacy which overrules all the
objections to limited liability is the fear that capitalists will not be
able to take care of their money without a little help from Parliament.
I think they may be safely trusted. You and I agree also in the practical
view of the question—that legislators and theorists overrate the extent
to which the actual possession of capital affords a guarantee to the
creditor. It is the character, experience, and connexions of the man
wanting credit, his knowledge of his business, and opportunities of
making it available in the struggle of life, that weigh with the shrewd
capitalists far more than the actual command of a few thousands more
or less of money in hand. I began business in partnership with two other
young men, and we only mustered a thousand pounds amongst us, and
more than half of it was borrowed. We all got on the ‘Peveril of the
Peak’ coach, and went from London to Manchester in the, at that day,
marvellously short space of twenty hours. We were literally so ignorant
of Manchester houses that we called for a directory at the hotel, and
turned to the list of ‘calico printers,’ theirs being the business with
which we were acquainted, and they being the people from whom we
felt confident we could obtain credit. And why? Because we knew
we should be able to satisfy them that we had advantages from our
large connexions, our knowledge of the best branch of the business in
London, and our superior taste in design, which would insure success.
We introduced ourselves to Fort Brothers and Co., a rich house, and
told our tale, honestly concealing nothing. In less than two years
from 1830 we owed them forty thousand pounds for goods which they
had sent to us in Watling Street, upon no other security than our
characters and knowledge of our business. I frequently talked with
them in later times upon the great confidence they showed in men who
avowed that they were not possessed of 200<i>l.</i> each. Their answer was
that they would always prefer to trust young men with connexions and
with a knowledge of their trade, if they knew them to possess character
and ability, to those who started with capital without these advantages,
and that they had acted on this principle successfully <i>in all parts of the
world</i>. We did not disappoint them or ourselves. In 1834-1835 our
stock takings showed a net balance of 20,000<i>l.</i> a year profit. Then I
began to write pamphlets and to talk politics, and from that moment
I ceased to make money, and in 1846, when the League finished its
labours, my children must have been beggars, had not my neighbours,
who knew my circumstances, originated the subscription which restored
me independence. I took the money without shame, because I had
earned it. If money had been my sole object in life I should have been
a more successful man by sticking to my calicoes, for my partners have
grown richer than I by doing so, and young men taken into the
concern since I left have made fortunes. I may add that the original
formation of the partnership, and the whole scheme of the business,
sprung exclusively from myself. But what has this to do with your
bill? I never detect myself falling into a twaddle about things
personal and past without suspecting that I am growing old and
garrulous. I doubt the policy of your presenting a bill to the House.
Your strength lies in your principle—<i>perfect freedom</i>—which you can
argue with more force when not compelled to enter upon details. If
you have any suggestions as to the clauses of the Bill, would it not be
better to do as you did with the Shipping Bill by giving the Board of
Trade the benefit of your hints? It may be necessary to concede
something for the sake of carrying any measure, but I doubt whether
any concession, beyond a registration, which may be shown to be a
convenience to all parties, will not be unsoundness. If it be necessary
to tamper with sound principles for the sake of pleasing the Lords, let
the proposal come from their party. I suspect we shall be weaker in
both Houses in dealing with the question of private partnership upon
free-trade principles than with that of Joint Stock Associations. Upon
the latter question, people of the —— and —— school of political
economy, whose principles are, if pushed home, a little socialistic, took
a great interest, because they have an amiable faith in the power of
association amongst the working classes. But I doubt whether they
will throw much zeal into the question of private partnership. By the
way, don’t put the question in the House in the form of a problem
A. B. C. D. &amp;c. It does in a written argument, and even then demands
a severe attention; but I find that that mode of stating the case in the
House does not succeed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord
John
Russell’s
first steps
as Prime
Minister:
the Equalization
of
the Sugar
Duties.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Suspends
the Navigation
Laws,
January
1847.</div>

<p>The first measure introduced by Lord John Russell,
when he succeeded Sir Robert Peel as Prime Minister,—the
equalization of the Sugar Duties—was one
almost as important to the interests of merchant
shipping as the repeal of the Corn Laws. A change
so great, affecting, indirectly, the general as well as
the fiscal policy of the empire, was even more remarkable
than the abolition of the Corn Laws. It
was strenuously opposed by the Protectionist party,
but Sir Robert Peel, having given his support to
Government, the Bill was carried by a large majority.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
This measure in itself afforded much additional employment
to shipping; and in the course of the
debate upon it, Lord John Russell made the memorable
declaration that he “did not propose in any
respect to alter the existing Navigation Laws.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> He
was, however, obliged immediately afterwards to
suspend the operation of these Laws till the 1st September
following, so as to facilitate the importation
of grain and flour. Indeed, some such measure was
absolutely necessary, as the crops of Germany and
France had in many instances failed, and the French
Government had also been compelled to suspend for
a time their Navigation Laws, in order to obtain
supplies of food from other countries.</p>

<p>As the necessity of increasing, at all events for a
limited period, the facilities for importing grain from
foreign countries and the admission of sugar more
freely into breweries and distilleries, so as to augment
the supply of food, had been pointed out in the Royal
Speech, no opposition was offered to this temporary
suspension of the Navigation Laws; but it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>stoutly maintained by the Protectionists that the suspension
must be limited to the period fixed in the
Bill. The Free-traders, however, on the other hand,
could not see the necessity of any limitation, and,
though the Ministry did not feel strong enough to
undertake the task of a total abolition of the Navigation
Laws, one of its principal supporters gave notice
that, on an early day, he would formally call the
attention of Parliament to this important subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr.
Ricardo’s
motion,
February
1847.</div>

<p>Accordingly, on the 9th February, 1847, Mr. John
Lewis Ricardo brought forward his motion,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> “That
a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into
the operation and policy of the Navigation Laws.”
Intense interest was excited among shipowners; the
fact of Mr. Ricardo proposing the motion was deemed
highly ominous, as he was known to hold very
advanced opinions on Free-trade, and to be prepared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>to go further in that direction than perhaps any other
member of the House. He was, indeed, at that time,
one of the most formidable exponents of the Free-trade
doctrines. His speech,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> delivered in a tone of
much confidence, propounded, as indisputable facts,
what were then rather startling assertions. After
briefly recapitulating the history of the Navigation
Act, which had been held to be perfect till 1821-22,
he pointed out that Mr. Wallace in those years, and
Mr. Huskisson in 1824-25, had broken into the exclusive
principle on which the Navigation Act rested.
He then referred, at great length, to the labours of
the Committee on British Shipping in 1844, and
boldly asserted that that inquiry was instituted by
the shipowners to prove the efficacy of the existing
laws, and was allowed to drop because they had
no case for further encouragement. He specially
singled out the opinions of the late Mr. Joseph
Somes, one of the largest shipowners of that time,
who went so far as to demand a tax on Colonial shipping;
and he successfully combatted this by contending
that the colonists already suffered severely by the
Navigation Laws. Millions upon millions, he said,
were spent upon internal communications;<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Parliament
was looking with great jealousy lest a half-penny
or a penny too much should be charged for
inland transit; yet, when goods arrived by sea, there
was a law which increased the cost of carriage over
the greater part of their journey. He then referred
to the opinions expressed by Mr. G. F. Young, one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>of the leading opponents of any change in the laws
of shipping, who had also advocated a tax on Colonial
vessels, stating, in his evidence in 1844-45, that he
“considered the whole system of Navigation Laws
as relating more to the encouragement of maritime
commerce than to any other object, and that, therefore,
many sacrifices of pecuniary interests ought to be
made for it,” adding, “I have no doubt that private
interests ought to be sacrificed for the general interests
of the country. If the Legislature should decide
that it was no longer necessary to keep up the Navigation
Laws as a means of national security, no
doubt the consumers of foreign articles could purchase
at a cheaper rate, since this would be the
natural consequence of admitting imports in the
ships of foreign nations.”</p>

<p>Fortified by these quotations from his opponent’s
evidence, Mr. Ricardo boldly came to the point by
asserting it must be clear that, by every ton of
shipping driven from the ports of England, there
was lost the benefit of the sale of an equivalent
amount of our merchandise, and that, thereby, our
workmen were deprived of their wages, our manufacturers
of their profit, and our Government of
revenue. If the Spaniards wanted earthenware, the
French sugar, and we wine, “why on earth,” he exclaimed,
“should we forbid the natural course of the
transaction!” He pointed out the roundabout and
expensive way whereby such exchanges of produce
must be carried,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> instancing a case where American
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>hides brought from Marseilles to Rotterdam, not
finding a market there, were taken back to Marseilles;
and when sent thence to Liverpool, were
seized as imported in a French bottom, and released
only on the condition that they should be sent
back to New York! Such interruptions of commerce,
Mr. Ricardo rightly contended, were alike
inconvenient and wasteful. He next pointed out
discrepancies in the working of the Act, with
the various Orders in Council made under it, asserting,
at the same time, that freights were artificially
enhanced by protection. He espoused, too, the
cause of the colonists, who now demanded as a
matter of justice, that trade should be as free in
shipping as it was in sugar. Could, Mr. Ricardo
demanded, any ground of political expediency
or any national advantage be shown to justify the
retention of these laws? He admitted that the
authority of Adam Smith would be adduced against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>him,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> but denied that Adam Smith had brought forward
evidence to support his argument. He allowed
that a defensive navy was of the first importance for
the welfare of the country, and that the commercial
marine was the nucleus and nursery of that branch
of the public service; but he emphatically contended
that the way to encourage the commercial navy was
to free the commerce of the country from all restrictions,
impediments, and obstructions. He held that
England could compete successfully with the United
States and all the world in building ships, and he
produced a variety of statistical statements showing
the difference between protected and unprotected
tonnage, one of which is especially worthy of notice.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>“These facts,” added Mr. Ricardo, “speak for themselves,
showing the unprotected tonnage has just
doubled the increase of the protected tonnage.” He
concluded by remarking that commerce was the
parent of the merchant marine, and that if the
parent were nourished the child would flourish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reply of
Mr.
Liddell.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mr.
Ricardo’s
motion
carried.</div>

<p>Mr. Thomas Milner Gibson, then Vice-President of
the Board of Trade, with whose concurrence the
motion had been made, gave the Government’s sanction
to the motion, and recommended on their part
that the Committee should be appointed. His proposal,
however, was strongly opposed by the Hon.
H. T. Liddell (now Earl Ravensworth), who asked
what could be gained by a Committee, as the Navigation
Laws were already suspended until the 1st of
September next. He quoted the opinion of Mr. Huskisson,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
who, in making certain recommendations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>with relation to the reciprocity treaties, had said:
“The object of the Navigation Laws was twofold:
first, to create and maintain the great commercial
marine of this country for the purposes of national
defence; and secondly, an object not less important
in the eyes of statesmen, to prevent any one other
nation from engrossing too large a portion of the
navigation of the world.” Mr. Huskisson, he stated,
held that, in those two branches of our maritime
system, the fisheries and the coasting trade, there
appeared no motive for alteration, and that the laws
referring to them must remain unchanged, so long
as we were desirous of upholding our great commercial
marine. With reference to the European trade,
he also declared that the altered state of the world
compelled England to enter into some new treaties;
that, in so far as exclusion was within their reach,
they were bound to grant and enforce a monopoly in
favour of the British shipowner—not, indeed, for his
especial advantage, but because the commercial marine
was the foundation of our naval power, and the maintenance
of that power the paramount duty of all
governments. It was Mr. Liddell’s opinion, however,
that the reciprocity treaties had ever been distasteful
to British shipowners, and, that they had suffered in
their carrying trade from unequal competition with
other countries; but that it was now too late to think
of giving them up or of altering a policy to which the
country had pledged itself. With regard to the comparative
expenses of British and foreign ships, it
suited, he said, the case of the Repealers to make this
comparison of expenses with the ships of the United
States alone; but why not look to the Baltic States,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
with the trade of which the whole of the eastern parts
of this island were directly connected? It was proved,
he urged, before a Committee of the House, that the
relative cost of a British and Russian ship, both as
regards construction and current expenses, was much
in favour of the latter, and he called, therefore, on
the House not to fritter away the great interests
committed to its charge. He, in a long and closely-reasoned
speech, strenuously opposed the appointment
of the Committee. The motion was supported
by Mr. Hume, Mr. Bright, Mr. Labouchere, Lord
Sandon, and Mr. Mitchell, and opposed by Lord G.
Bentinck, Alderman Thompson, Captain Harris, Mr.
Hudson, and Mr. Disraeli; but, Sir Robert Peel
having given a very decided opinion in favour of
inquiry, and Lord John Russell having supported
the proposal on the part of the Government, Mr.
Ricardo’s motion was carried by 155 to 61.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Committee
appointed,
February
1847.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Meeting of
Shipowners’
Society,
August
12, 1847.</div>

<p>This was the first blow aimed with serious effect
against the existence of the Navigation Laws; and,
though the Free-trade party affected slightly to disguise
their intentions by only asking for inquiry,
their zealous partisans out of doors made no scruple
in avowing that the total abolition of the Navigation
Laws was the real object of their agitation. Circumstances
connected with this inquiry led the
General Body of Shipowners to hold a special meeting
on the 12th August, 1847, but, curiously enough,
they did not advance a single remark on the increasing
activity of their own business, brought about as this
had been in a great measure by the legislation to
which I have referred. It cannot be questioned that,
if British shipowners had suffered severely in previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
years, the reductions in the tariff since 1842, together
with the demand for shipping to bring supplies of
food for the starving populace of Ireland, had greatly
increased their actual business and their future prospects.
Nor were other causes wanting to enhance
and to ensure this prosperity. A new trade had
been developed by the discovery of vast deposits of
guano in the islands of the Pacific (of far greater
importance than those on the coasts of Africa), and
this alone required a large amount of tonnage; while
the rapidly increasing consumption of sea-borne coals
secured for them another source of remunerative
employment. In spite of these obvious advantages,
shipowners, however, expressed no feelings of satisfaction,
though these new channels of trade afforded
them a profitable employment for their vessels: they
probably feared that by so doing the Free-traders
would at once introduce a measure for the repeal of
the Navigation Laws. Nor were their fears groundless.
Parliament having thrown out the idea that
protection as a principle could not be maintained,
the shipowner had to show that his case, as the
advocate of maritime commerce generally, was an
exception to this rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their arguments.</div>

<p>The Shipowners’ Society of London alleged, with
no mean tact and ability, that their members, as a
section of the community, advanced no claim to
special privileges, and demanded no exemption on
abstract grounds, from any burdens to which other
interests were subjected. But they argued that, if
for objects of supposed national benefit wherein they
had no special advantage, the State imposed on them
burdens and restrictions, common justice prescribed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
that they should be protected from the competition
of those who were not so tied down, otherwise they
would not be able to compete with the shipowners of
foreign nations. They further argued, and not without
reason, that, by the Registry Laws they were
compelled to use the most costly ships in the world;
by the Navigation Laws to employ exclusively the
highest paid and most expensively fed seamen, those
of native birth; and, by a variety of laws, presumed,
also, to be of essential importance, they were specially
taxed, and, at the same time, were prevented from conducting
their pursuits in the way most conducive to
their own profit. Clinging, however, tenaciously as
they did to the principle of the Navigation Laws,
they could hardly expect that their view in favour of
protection to their own interest would be entertained;
and this, too, at a period when every vessel at their
command was fully employed; when they were realizing
large profits, and when, indeed, ships could
scarcely be found to convey from other countries sufficient
food to meet the wants of the people.</p>

<p>The Committee<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> who were appointed on Mr.
Ricardo’s motion had examined during the session
a great number of witnesses, and in the course of
their inquiry made no less than five reports, limiting
themselves, however, to the evidence taken, the
substance of which I shall hereafter lay before my
readers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What constitutes
“British
Ships.”</div>

<p>But before I do so, it is necessary, even at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>risk of wearying my readers, that I should give the
meaning which has been usually attached to “British
ships,” especially as this has varied in different trades
and, from time to time, in the same trade, and explain,
in as condensed a manner as possible, the more important
changes in the old Navigation Laws, not
already noticed or sufficiently described. Originally,
a “British ship” was held to be one owned by
the people of England, Ireland, &amp;c., or, if built in the
Plantations, owned by the people thereof, being British
subjects. In 1786, an Act was passed (26 Geo. III.,
c. 60), by which it was provided for the future that
no ships should be entitled to the privilege of
“British ships” but such as were British built as
well as British owned and navigated; exceptions,
however, being made in favour of foreign ships built
before May, 1786, and belonging, at that date, to
English owners. Ships of this class might engage in
all such voyages as were previously open to British-owned
ships though not necessarily of British build.
From the time that these ships of 1786, or of older
date, became worn out, the term “British ship” acquired
the sense in which it was used, up to 1847,
except as regards the coasting trade, for which this
further provision was made, that no foreigner was
permitted to serve in her as a seaman.</p>

<p>It is also necessary to notice the effect of some
clauses in the Act of 34 Geo. III., cap. 68, which provided
that no ship, registered or required to be registered
as a British ship, could import or export any
articles whatsoever, unless duly navigated by British
subjects. Thus a restriction, previously unknown,
was placed on our export trade to foreign parts, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
on the import from Europe of other articles than those
enumerated in the Act of Navigation.</p>

<p>On further examination of the Navigation Act, it
will be seen that exceptions from its general rules
occur in two instances (Levant and East India goods)
in favour of certain imports in British-<i>built</i> ships;
while, in two other instances (Spanish and Portuguese
colonial goods, bullion and prize goods), they were
in favour of importations in British-<i>owned</i> shipping.</p>

<p>Lastly, provision was made in the 10th and 11th
sections of the “Act for the Prevention of Frauds”
(13 &amp; 14 Car. II., cap. 2) with reference to the purchase
of foreign-built ships, and for securing that such
ships should be wholly owned by English persons,
before they could avail themselves of the privileges
conferred by the Act on such ships.</p>

<p>Such were the leading conditions of the “Act of
Navigation” so far as regards “British ships;” but
the “Statute of Frauds” further enacted (sect. 6,
par. 2) that no foreign-built ship (that is to say, no
ship built anywhere except in England, &amp;c., or in
his Majesty’s dominions in Asia, Africa, or America),
except ships purchased before a given day and prize
ships, should enjoy the privilege of a “British ship,”
though owned and manned by “British subjects”;
and such ships were deemed as aliens’ ships, and were
liable therefore to all duties applicable to this class
of vessels.</p>

<p>By a subsequent Act (15 Car. II., cap. 7, sect. 6)
no goods from Europe were to be imported into the
British possessions except in British-built shipping;
and, by the Plantation Act (7 &amp; 8 Will. III., cap. 22,
sect. 2) all importations into, and exportations from,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
these possessions must be in British-owned, and
British-built, and British-navigated vessels. Prize
ships, if British owned, were, and always have been,
entitled to the privileges of British vessels; the
system of registering vessels having been first prescribed
by the last-named Act.</p>

<p>Having thus stated the principles regulating
“British ships,” I must now proceed to notice in some
detail the more important changes in the Navigation
Laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State of
Navigation
Laws
in 1847.
Rules in
force in
the Plantation
Trade.</div>

<p>These Laws, in 1847, resting as they did on the
Act of Parliament then in force, so far as regards
<i>The Plantation Trade</i> provided (<i>Rule 1</i>) that “No
goods shall be <i>exported</i> from the United Kingdom to
any British possession in Asia, Africa, or America,
nor to the islands of Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, or
Sark, except in British ships” (8 &amp; 9 Vict., cap. 88,
sect. 7). But vessels belonging to the United States
may carry goods from this country to the principal
British settlements in the East Indies (59 Geo. III.,
cap. 54, sect. 6). The Sovereign had the power to
conclude treaties, allowing the same privilege to
the ships of other foreign countries, and some such
treaties were actually concluded: <i>e.g.</i> with Austria and
in fact Russia (see 8 &amp; 9 Vict., cap. 90, sect. 9).</p>

<p><i>Rule 2.</i> “No goods shall be carried from any
British possession in Asia, Africa, or America,
to any other of such possessions, nor from one part
of such possessions to another part of the same,
except in British ships” (8 &amp; 9 Vict., cap. 88, sect.
10).</p>

<p><i>Rule 3.</i> “No goods shall be <i>imported</i> into any
British possession in Asia, Africa, or America, in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
foreign ships, unless they be ships of the country
producing these goods, and from which they are
usually imported”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> (8 &amp; 9 Vict., cap. 88, sect. 11).
But an Order in Council might declare that goods, &amp;c.,
the growth of any foreign country, might be imported
into Hong Kong from the same or any other foreign
country, in vessels belonging to the same or any
other foreign country, and however navigated (see
8 &amp; 9 Vict., cap. 88, sect. 12).</p>

<p>Her Majesty might also, by Order in Council, declare
that goods of any sort, or the produce of any
place, not otherwise prohibited by the Law of Navigation,
might be imported into any port or ports of
the British possessions abroad, to be named in such
Order, from any place, <i>in a British ship</i>, and from
any place not being a part of the British dominions,
in a foreign ship of any country, and however navigated,
to be warehoused for <i>exportation</i> only (8 &amp; 9
Vict., cap. 88, sect. 23).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
rigorous
character.</div>

<p><i>Rule 4.</i> The privileges of trading allowed to
foreign ships under <i>Rule 3</i> were limited to the ships
of those countries which, <i>having colonial possessions</i>,
should grant the like privileges of trading with those
possessions to British ships, or which, not having
colonial possessions, “shall place the commerce and
navigation of this country, and of its possessions
abroad, on the footing of the ‘most favoured nation’:
unless her Majesty, by Order in Council, shall
in any case deem it expedient to grant the whole, or
any of such privileges, to the ships of any foreign
country, although the conditions aforesaid shall not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
in all respects be fulfilled by such foreign country”
(8 &amp; 9 Vict., cap. 93, sect. 4).</p>

<p><i>Rule 5.</i> “No goods shall be <i>imported</i> into, nor shall
any goods (except the produce of the fisheries, in
British ships) be <i>exported</i>, from any of the British
possessions in America by sea, from or to any place
other than the United Kingdom, or some other of
such possessions, except into or from the several ports
in such possessions called ‘Free Ports.’” (See 8 &amp; 9
Vict., cap. 93, sect. 2.) The 62nd section of the Act
applied this principle to the Mauritius, as well as
to the American possessions; while, under the 90th
section, the trade of other colonies was regulated
by the Queen. Goods could be imported by inland
navigation into any place where there was a custom-house.
The rule was not to extend “to prohibit the
importation or exportation of goods into or from
any ports or places in Newfoundland, or Labrador,
in British ships;” and by the 2nd section, certain
articles might be imported from Guernsey and Jersey
into places where the fishery was carried on, though
the same were not free ports. These five rules comprise
the Law as it stood in 1847. But it is also as
well to give some account of its previous history and
its various modifications.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
history
from 1660
to 1847.</div>

<p>The Act of 1660 established two rules applicable
to the Plantation trade, which were deemed of the
highest importance to the country: first, that the
whole trade of the Plantations should be carried on
in “British” ships only; and secondly, that the principal
productions of these Plantations should be allowed
to be exported only to the mother country, or some
other Plantation. A third general rule was introduced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
a year or two later, by the Act of 15 Car. II.,
cap. 7, sect. 6, viz., that no goods of the produce of
Europe should be imported into any of the Plantations
in Asia, Africa, or America (except Tangier<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>),
in any vessels whatsoever, but such as were <i>bonâ
fide</i> and without fraud laden and shipped in England,
Wales, or the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, in English-built
vessels.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1825, on the general consolidation of
the Customs Laws, the above limitations of the right
of exportation were removed, and the law with regard
to the <i>Plantation trade</i> was placed nearly on the
footing on which it stood in 1847. In fact, the
further consolidations of 1833 and 1845 made little
change in the previous regulations. With regard to
<i>Rule 3</i>, viz., that goods, the produce of Europe, were
only to be imported into the colonies from the United
Kingdom, this was subject, originally, to a few exceptions:
thus, salt might be taken to the fisheries from
any port of Europe; and wines of Madeira and the
Azores might be imported thence, &amp;c. A relaxation
of the rule was first made in favour of Irish linens,
various subsequent alterations having been introduced,
till at length, in 1825, the law with reference
to such importations was placed on nearly the same
footing as prevailed in 1847; that is to say, the importation
and exportation of all classes of goods into
or from the “Free Ports” in different colonies were,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>generally, legalised, subject to certain prohibitions
against the importation of particular articles, some
of which were afterwards removed, while others
(<i>e.g.</i> those against pirated books, counterfeit coin,
&amp;c., and the restrictions on gunpowder, arms, &amp;c.)
remained. A tariff of differential duties on foreign
goods, of which duties one-tenth (subsequently increased
to one-fourth) was to be remitted, when the
goods were imported through an English warehouse,
was, at the same date, enforced.</p>

<p>The principle of this tariff and of the practice of
remission were retained; but legislation was constantly
effecting small changes, to meet the wishes
or, rather, the demands of colonial legislatures which
perhaps, naturally, looked only to their own interests.</p>

<p>Such may be taken as the intermediate history of
the Navigation Law as it affected the Plantation or
Colonial trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First infringement
of the principle
of
confining
the American
trade
to British
vessels.</div>

<p>The first decided infringement of the general principle
of confining the trade to British ships took
place on the conclusion of the treaty with America,
the effect of which has been described.</p>

<p>In 1808, when the King of Portugal emigrated to
Brazil, the same privileges, as had been granted to
the United States, were extended to the inhabitants
of the Portuguese possessions in South America, by
the Act (48 Geo. III., cap. 11) which allowed the produce
of those territories to be imported thence into
Great Britain and Ireland in vessels built in those
territories, or made prize by Portuguese ships, and
owned and navigated by Portuguese subjects resident
in the said territories. After the conclusion of
the treaty with Portugal in 1810, a further Act<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
(51 Geo. III., cap. 47) extended the above facilities
to all Portuguese-built vessels or prizes owned and
navigated by Portuguese subjects, without requiring
that they should be residents in America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absurdity
and impotency
of
these laws.</div>

<p>On the revision of the Customs Laws in 1822
(3 Geo. IV., cap. 43, sect. 3), the principle and the
above exceptions in favour of the United States and
Portuguese colonies were preserved, and were further
extended to countries in America or the West Indies,
being, or having been, under the dominion of Spain.
It must be remembered that, as respects the principle
that the produce of Asia, Africa, and America
was only to be imported into England from the place
of its origin, the old law recognised the doctrine of
the 5th section of the Navigation Act, that goods
<i>manufactured</i> in any country should be held to be <i>the
produce of that country</i>, even though made from materials
produced elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State of
the law
before the
Declaration
of
American
Independence.</div>

<p>At the commencement of the American War of
Independence, the chief regulations as to trade, the
operations of which have been already described,
were that the Americans could neither import nor
export in any but British ships; they could not
carry important articles of their own produce to
any part of Europe other than Great Britain; and
they could not import any goods from any part of
Europe other than Great Britain.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Trade
with
Europe.</div>

<p>With regard to the <i>trade with Europe</i>, the law in
1847 declared that the several sorts of goods hereinafter
enumerated, being the produce of Europe, viz.,
masts, timber, boards, tar, tallow, hemp, flax, currants,
raisins, figs, prunes, olive-oil, corn or grain,
wine, brandy, tobacco, wool, shumach, madders,
madder-roots, barilla, brimstone, bark of oak, cork,
oranges, lemons, linseed, rape-seed and clover-seed,
could not be imported into the United Kingdom, <i>to
be used therein</i>, except in British ships, or in ships of
the country of which the goods were the produce, or
in ships of the country from which they were usually
imported, 8 &amp; 9 Vict., cap. 88, sect. 2. But such
goods, not being otherwise prohibited, might, by the
22nd section of that Act, be warehoused for exportation,
though brought in other ships; a privilege
confirmed by the 3 &amp; 4 Vict., cap. 95.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modifications
of
the law.</div>

<p>Some embarrassing questions having, from time to
time, arisen as to the right of importing the produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
of particular European States in ships built in countries
incorporated into those States subsequent to the
passing of the Navigation Act, as, for instance, the
question whether Prussian produce might be imported
in ships built in East Friesland, it was enacted,
22 Geo. III., cap. 78, that the enumerated articles
might be imported in ships, the property of subjects
under the same sovereign as the country of which
goods were the produce, although the country or place
where such ship was built or to which it belonged,
was not under the dominion of such sovereign at the
time of the passing of the Navigation Act. It will
be observed that this statute not only effected its
immediate purpose of putting the dominions and
sovereign of any one country on the same footing in
respect to the Navigation Law, but also extended
the right of importing, originally confined to ships
“built in” the country of export, to ships “belonging
to” such country. Several alterations of an unimportant
character were made, bearing upon these
points; but, in the consolidation of 1825, the proviso
was introduced into the Navigation Act, and still
retained in 1847, “that the country of every ship
shall be deemed to include all places which are
under the same dominion as the place to which such
ship belongs.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, the Act of 1822 (3 Geo.
IV., cap. 43, sect. 6) had made an important alteration
in the law, by allowing importations of the
enumerated goods, either in ships of the country of
which the goods were the produce, or in ships of the
country whence these goods were usually imported.
At the same time, the prohibitions against the importation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
of articles from the Netherlands, Germany,
Turkey, and Russia were taken off.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In 1822 tallow and tobacco were also added to the
list of enumerated articles: and, since that time,
wool, shumach, madder, barilla, brimstone, bark,
cork, oranges, lemons, linseed, rape-seed, and clover-seed
have likewise been added; while salt, pitch,
rosin, potashes, wine, and sugar were struck out.</p>

<p>The only alteration of any consequence in the
European trade, since the consolidation of 1825, was
that made to carry out the Austrian Treaty of 1838,
which will be noticed hereafter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">East India
trade and
shipping.</div>

<p>The trade, however, with the East Indies has
always been exceptional, and deserves special notice,
as the exclusive right of trading within certain
limits, long enjoyed by the Company, together with
the peculiar nature of the Company’s jurisdiction,
produced some anomalies.</p>

<p>The two points most worthy of notice are, first,
the concession of the rights of British ships to ships
not fulfilling all the usual requisites of the law;
and secondly, the admission of certain foreign ships
to an equality in some respects with British ships.</p>

<p>On the first point, the statute 21 Geo. III., cap. 65,
sect. 33, provided that ships belonging to the East
India Company should be held to be British owned,
although the Stock of the Company was held by a
considerable number of foreigners. Other statutes
(35 Geo. III., cap. 118; 42 Geo. III., cap. 20) allowed
to ships built within the territories of the Company, or
in places in the East Indies under British protection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>and owned by the Company, the privileges of British
ships in trade with India, though such ships were
neither British built nor duly registered. When the
exclusive privileges of the Company were broken
in upon (53 Geo. III., cap. 155) the same privilege
was extended to similarly circumstanced vessels, the
property of private individuals, by Order in Council.
But when the Registry Laws were extended to India,
from this time nothing but British-built ships were to
be entitled to the privileges of British vessels (54
Geo. III., cap. 35; 53 Geo. III., cap. 116). Exceptions
were made in favour of ships under 350 tons burden,
and of others, the property of British subjects, and
built or building before 1st January, 1816: but these
classes of ships were only to be employed in trade
within the limits of the Company’s Charter. Subsequent
changes were made; and, by the Act 3 &amp; 4
Vict., cap. 56, in force in 1847, the Governor-General
in Council had power given him to declare all ships
built within the limits of the Charter, and owned
by those of Her Majesty’s subjects for whom he had
power to legislate, entitled to the privileges of
British ships within those limits. By the fourth
section of the same Act, the Governor-General had,
also, the power of conferring the same privileges
on ships belonging to States in subordinate alliance,
or having subsidiary treaties with the East India
Company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trade with
India, in
Foreign
and
United
States
Ships,</div>

<p>With regard to the navigation of East India ships,
it is sufficient to notice, that, by the 20th section of
4 Geo. IV., cap. 80 (still in force in 1847), as well as by
the 17th section of the Navigation Act (8 &amp; 9 Vict.,
cap. 88), Lascars and other natives of Asia were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
to be deemed British seamen. But by section 21 of
the same Act, any number of Lascars might be employed;
provided only that there were four British
seamen to every hundred tons of the vessel’s burden:
by section 23, however, it appears that British seamen
need not be employed in certain voyages within
the limits of the Charter.</p>

<p>On the subject of privileges granted to vessels of
foreign countries in the trade with India, reference
must be made to Act 37 Geo. III., cap. 117 (still unrepealed
in 1847), which authorised the Directors of
the East India Company, subject to the approval of
the Board of Control, to make such regulations as they
thought fit with respect to the trade to be carried on
in ships of countries on friendly terms with England.
The case, however, of America was peculiar, in this
sense, that her ships were enabled to clear out from
English ports to China, while English merchants could
not send a British ship to that country! Thus, the Act
of 59 Geo. III., cap. 54, sect. 6, allowed United States
ships “to clear out from any port of the United
Kingdom for the principal settlements of the <i>British</i>
dominions in the East Indies,—<i>videlicet</i>, Calcutta,
Madras, Bombay, and Prince of Wales Island,—with
any articles which could be legally exported from the
United Kingdom to the said settlements in British-built
ships, subject to the same regulations, &amp;c., as
applied to British-built ships.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">even from
English
ports.</div>

<p>It was under the security of this clause that the
traders of the United States sent their vessels to the
port of London, to clear out, not for the special ports
mentioned in the above Act, but for China, the only
exclusive trade at that time retained by the East<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
India Company. Whether the omission of the word
China in the Act was an inadvertence, or whether it
was, in fact, a violation of the law for United States
vessels to go to Canton as well as to the other places
within the limits of the Company’s Charter detailed
in this Act, the authorities of the Board of Trade
did not care to distinguish.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Coasting
Trade.</div>

<p>As regards the <span class="smcap">Coasting Trade</span>, the law—8 &amp; 9
Vict., cap. 88, sect. 8—in force in 1847, declared
that no goods nor passengers could be carried coastwise
from one part of the United Kingdom to another,
or from the United Kingdom to the Isle of Man,
and <i>vice versâ</i>, except in British ships, although the
original Navigation Act of 1660 did not prevent
foreign-built vessels from engaging in the coasting
trade. The prohibition in the ancient Act extended
only to such as were <i>foreign owned</i>, 12 Car. II.,
cap. 18, sect. 8. By the Act of 1 James, cap. 18, an
extra duty of 5<i>s.</i> per ton for every voyage was laid
upon all foreign-built ships engaged in this trade.
Subsequently, by 34 Geo. III., cap. 68 (extended to
Irish ships by 42 Geo. III., cap. 61), it was enacted,
that vessels engaged in the coasting trade should be
wholly navigated by British subjects; and this provision
was still in force in 1847 by virtue of the
definition of a “British ship,” given in the 12th section
of the Act of 8 &amp; 9 Vict., cap. 88. The absolute
restriction of the coasting trade to British-built ships
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>was not introduced till the consolidation in 1825.
The trade of the Isle of Man was put on the footing
of a coasting trade in 1844.</p>

<p>Such is an abridged history of the law of Navigation
during the intermediate period between 1660
and 1847, comprising the four great divisions of the
trade and navigation of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>No one can rise from a study of these laws without
a feeling of amazement at the trouble our ancestors
gave themselves “to beggar their neighbours,” under
the erroneous impression which too long prevailed,
that, by their ruin, our own prosperity could be most
effectively achieved. It is, therefore, not surprising
that, under such legislative measures, maritime commerce
was for centuries slow in growth, and that
British merchants and shipowners frequently suffered
quite as much through the instrumentality of laws
meant for their protection as their foreign competitors,
against whom these regulations were levelled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary
of the
Navigation
Laws.</div>

<p>For the convenience of reference it may be useful
to give before closing this chapter a condensed recapitulation
of the principles of these extraordinary
laws, as they stood in 1847, so that my readers may
more clearly understand the discussions in the Lords
and Commons preceding their repeal:—</p>

<p>1st. Certain enumerated articles of European produce
could only be imported into the United Kingdom,
for consumption, in British ships, or in ships of the
country of which the goods were the produce, or in
ships of the country from which they were usually
imported.</p>

<p>2ndly. No produce of Asia, Africa, or America
could be imported for consumption into the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Kingdom from <i>Europe</i> in any ships; and such produce
could only be imported from any other place in
British ships, or in ships of the country of which the
goods were the produce and from which they were
usually imported.</p>

<p>3rdly. No goods could be carried coastwise from
one part of the United Kingdom to another in any
but British ships.</p>

<p>4thly. No goods could be exported from the United
Kingdom to any of the British possessions in Asia,
Africa, or America (with some exceptions with regard
to India), in any but British ships.</p>

<p>5thly. No goods could be carried from any one
British possession in Asia, Africa, or America to
another, nor from one part of such possession to
another part of the same in any but British ships.</p>

<p>6thly. No goods could be imported into any
British possession in Asia, Africa, or America, in any
but British ships, or in ships of the country of which
the goods were the produce, provided, also, in such
case, that such ships brought the goods from that
country.</p>

<p>7thly. No foreign ships were allowed to trade with
any of the British possessions unless they had been
specially authorised to do so by Order in Council;
and</p>

<p>8thly. Powers were given to the Queen in Council
which enabled her to impose differential duties on the
ships of any foreign country which did the same with
reference to British ships; and also to place restrictions
on importations from any foreign countries
which placed restrictions on British importations into
such countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>It will be remarked, that in the regulations respecting
the trade of Europe the restrictions only applied
to <i>imports</i>. Exports were not affected; in fact, so far
as the Navigation Act was concerned, foreign ships
might export any goods from this country. British
manufacturers had naturally required that no impediment
should be placed upon the exportation of
British goods. This was perhaps the only sensible
clause in the whole paraphernalia of these laws.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> I daresay at that time Lord Russell had not studied the question
sufficiently. I arrive at this conclusion from a note I received from his
Lordship in the present year (1875), in which he says, referring to the
repeal of the Navigation Laws:—“I felt convinced by the reasoning
of all writers, of whom the present Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Sir Stafford Northcote, was one of the most able, that the Navigation
Laws ought to be repealed. I was not frightened by Lord Derby’s
sinister predictions, and events have proved me right.” Sir Stafford
Northcote at the time was, I think, private secretary to Mr. Labouchere,
the President of the Board of Trade under Lord John Russell’s
Administration, and it is curious to learn that his Lordship, then the
Prime Minister and leader of the great Whig party, should have been
made a convert to the necessity of <i>further</i> progress by the young Conservative.
Of course these writings could not have been read by Lord
Russell at the time when he made the “declaration” to which I refer
in the text.</p>

steps taken in the repeal of the Navigation Laws, with the references
to <i>Hansard</i>, where the several speeches can be consulted:—</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="label">[44]</a> We give the words of Adam Smith, p. 203 <i>et seq.</i> of his ‘Wealth of
Nations,’ by McCulloch. <i>Ed.</i> 1850. “There seem to be two cases in
which it will be advantageous to lay some burden upon foreign for the
encouragement of domestic industry. The first is, when some particular
sort of industry is necessary for the defence of the country. The
defence of Great Britain, for example, depends very much upon the
number of its sailors and shipping. The Act of Navigation, therefore,
very properly endeavours to give the sailors and shipping of Great
Britain the monopoly of the trade of their own country, in some cases
by absolute prohibition, and in others by heavy burdens upon the
shipping of foreign countries.” Adam Smith, at great length, expounds
the principle of the Navigation Laws, admitting at the same time that
they are not favourable to the growth of the opulence arising from
foreign commerce. “As defence, however,” he adds, “is of much more
importance than opulence, the Act of Navigation is perhaps the wisest
of all the commercial regulations of England.”</p>

<p>In another passage, Adam Smith says: “To expect, indeed, that
freedom of trade should ever be entirely restored in Great Britain,
is as absurd as to expect that an Oceana or Utopia should ever be
established in it.” P. 207. Same Edition.</p>

as I have done, though perhaps not to much advantage, 14 Geo. III.,

rapid succession under the melancholy delusion that they would have the
effect of a Pope’s Bull!—and that, too, on an enlightened but oppressed
people, who had resolved to govern themselves! My readers may then
turn to 23 Geo. III., cap. 26, and 23 Geo. III., cap. 39, where an attempt
was made to mend matters by some sort of regulation of trade between
the two countries, whereby Great Britain resolved to have the lion’s

28 Geo. III., cap. 6, where certain modifications were made, or rather
could be made by “Order in Council,” and where “thirty enumerated
articles” the “growth, produce, or manufactures of the States,”
might be “carried into the British West Indies from the United
States,” but then “<i>only</i> by British subjects in British ships”! If
my readers are disposed to go further—though I cannot recommend
the research—into this wretched system of legislation, they may
refer to 31 Geo. III. cap. 38, where the Governors of the West India
Islands were allowed to relax certain prohibitions “in case of
public emergency;” and to 51 Geo. III., cap. 47, sect. 6, and 58 Geo. III.,

extending certain “privileges”!—<i>rights</i> (?)—to an independent and

<div class="sidenote">Progress
of the

the Navigation
Laws.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Reciprocity
Treaties.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Austria,
July 1838.</div>

<p>The first instance of privileges being granted to
ships of certain countries to import goods from
ports in other countries was in the case of Austrian
ships. The 4th clause of the treaty of 1838 between
Austria and England provided, that all Austrian
vessels from ports of the Danube, as far as Galatz
inclusive, should, with their cargoes, be admitted into
the ports of the United Kingdom and into all possessions
of Her Britannic Majesty, exactly in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
same manner as if the said vessels had come direct
from ports strictly Austrian, with all the privileges
and immunities granted under the Treaty of Navigation
and Commerce. In August 1840, an Act was
passed to give effect to this treaty, the 3rd clause of
which, running as follows, was very important:—“And
whereas, by the application of <i>steam</i> power<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> to
inland navigation, and the facility thereby afforded
of ascending rivers in suitable vessels with imported
goods, new prospects of commercial adventure are
opened up to many States situate wholly or chiefly
in the interior of Europe, and whose most convenient
ports are not within their own dominions; and, consequently,
the trade of this country with such States
might be greatly extended if the ships of such States
were permitted to use, for the purposes of such trade,
some ports of other States, in like manner as if such
ports were within their own dominions; and, accordingly,
treaties of commerce and navigation beneficial
to the shipping and trade of this country might be
made with such States if Her Majesty were enabled
to carry such treaties into effect. Be it therefore
enacted, notwithstanding the Navigation Act, that it
shall be lawful for Her Majesty from time to time to
declare, by the Order in Council, to be published as
aforesaid, that any port or ports to be named in such
order, being the most convenient port or ports for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
shipping the produce of any State, to be also named
in such order, shall, although not situated within the
dominions of such State, be port or ports for the use
of such State in the trade of such ships with all ports
of the British dominions, &amp;c., in as full and ample a
manner as if such port or ports were within the
dominions of such State, &amp;c.; and so long as such
order shall be declared to be in force, it shall be
lawful to import, &amp;c., any goods in the ships of such
State, which, by the laws in force at the time of such
importation, might then be imported in such ships
from a port of the country to which they belonged,
and so to import such goods upon the like terms as
the same could there be imported from the national
ports of such ships.” Subsequently to this Act, several
Conventions of Navigation, to some of which I have
already briefly referred, were carried out, whereby
the privileges just described were granted to various
other nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zollverein
States,
August
1841.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Russia,
1843.</div>

<p>The first was with Prussia, on behalf of the Zollverein
States,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> whereby the mouths of the Meuse,
Elbe, Weser, and Ems, and those of all the navigable
rivers between the Elbe and the Meuse were made
free; thus offering means of communication between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>the sea and the territory of any of the Zollverein
States thus opened as ports for ships of the Zollverein,
so far as relates to trade with the United Kingdom
or the British possessions. A little later, in 1843,
a similar treaty was made with Russia, by which
Russian vessels, arriving from the mouth of the
Vistula or Niemen, or any other river, the outlet of
any navigable stream, having its source in Russia
and passing through the Czar’s dominions, were admitted,
as if coming from Russian or Finnish ports.
With Oldenburg there was also a treaty relating to
the Elbe, Ems, Weser, and Meuse, and also with
Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Lastly, like arrangements
were made with Hanover, giving very nearly the
same privileges as those to Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
At a later period, orders were given to allow the
same indulgence to ships of Oldenburg, the Hanse
Towns, and Holland, as had been given to Hanover;
so that, at this time, England had relaxed her Navigation
Laws to the extent of calling ports, places not
geographically belonging to Austria, Russia, Oldenburg,
Mecklenburg, the Zollverein, Hanover, or the
Hanse Towns; a concession of vast importance, especially
as regarded the import of corn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Various
anomalies,
&amp;c., then in
existence.</div>

<p>In fact, the Navigation Laws, as they stood in 1847,
were full of anomalies, and were altogether unsuited
for the state of things at which nations had now
arrived. The 7th clause of the Act 7 &amp; 8 Vict., cap. 88,
directed, that “no goods shall be <i>exported</i> from the
United Kingdom to any <i>British possession</i> in <i>Asia</i>,
Africa, or America, nor to the islands of Guernsey,
Jersey, Alderney, or Sark, except in British ships.”
Goods, the produce of colonies in Asia, Africa, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
America, could, however, be brought in vessels of
any flag to the Channel Islands, but, from these, they
must be brought in a British ship; and there was
also the further anomaly, as we have shown, of
United States vessels being allowed to clear out with
produce and manufactures of the United Kingdom
to the East Indies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Curious
effects of
the
Registry
Laws</div>

<div class="sidenote">as regarded
individuals
or
corporate
bodies.</div>

<p>Power was then, also, granted to the Queen in
Council to allow any foreign nation to trade with
British colonies; and this privilege was granted to a
considerable number. To some it was accorded without
restriction; to others, such as France and Spain, who
were rivals, restricted powers were given; while the
privilege, granted to the United States of trading with
British colonies, was afterwards accorded to Columbia,
Rio de la Plata (including the States since formed),
Mexico, Hayti, Chili, France to a limited extent,
and the Spanish Colonies; and, further, all countries
within what were called the limits of the East India
Company’s Charter, that is, all foreign countries west
of Cape Horn, and east of the Cape of Good Hope,
had liberty to trade with the British possessions
within the same limits. (Order in Council, 16 July,
1827.) French ships under this order were, however,
only allowed to import into British colonies such
goods, the produce of France, as were enumerated in
the table annexed to the order (Orders, 1 June, 1826;
16 Dec., 1826), this order not including wine, the
staple of France, a distinction deliberately adopted and
confirmed. But, besides these perplexing anomalies,
and others to which I shall presently call attention,
the execution of the Navigation Law, as it was in
1847, was full of difficulties arising from the Registry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
Law, and the naturalisation of goods brought to
Europe, &amp;c. With respect to the Registry Law, there
was a clause (the 13th) of the Navigation Act which
stated “that no ship shall be admitted to be a British
ship unless duly registered;” and that this might be
properly done, the owner had to declare “that no
foreigner has any right, share, or interest in the
ship.” The following remarkable case will show
how completely the spirit of this old law was neutralised
in the case of Joint-Stock Companies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ship
<i>Equador</i>.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Decision
of Queen’s
Bench,
December
1846.</div>

<p>An application was made to the Collector at Liverpool
for the registry of a ship called the <i>Equador</i>,
belonging to the Pacific Steam Navigation Company.
In the first instance, the Company required registry
as a Joint-Stock Company, and three members, who
had been duly elected and appointed trustees, attended
at the Custom-House, Liverpool, to subscribe
the requisite declaration of registry, in conformity
with the provisions of the 13th and 36th sections of
the Act 8 &amp; 9 Vict., cap. 89 (the Registry Act). By
the 13th section, the trustees of a Joint-Stock Company,
in common with all other owners of British
ships (<i>excepting those owned by corporate bodies</i>), were
required to declare “that no foreigner, directly or
indirectly, hath any share or part interest in the
said ship or vessel.” The trustees in question stated
that they could not make that declaration, because,
in point of fact, foreigners did hold shares in that
ship, and also in the other vessels belonging to the
said Company; and they requested the Collector and
Controller at Liverpool to expunge from the declaration
the words above recited; but those officers,
having no legal authority to comply with this request,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
refused to make this alteration. The Company
then addressed the Board of Customs, requesting
that they would direct their officers at Liverpool
to expunge from the declaration the words above
recited; but the Board, acting under advice, refused
compliance with the request. The Company’s secretary
then demanded registry on behalf of the Company
as a “corporate body,” and claimed to make the
declaration, contained in the 13th section of the Act
aforesaid, which applies to corporate bodies. That
declaration does not, like the other declaration,
exclude foreign interest; and if, in the first instance,
the Company had claimed registry as a corporate
body, the probability is, that it would have been
granted as a matter of course, without raising the
question of foreign interest. But the Collector and
Controller at Liverpool, with a full knowledge that
foreigners were proprietors of the vessel, and adverting
to the 13th and other sections of the Registry
Act, refused registry; and the Commissioners of
Customs, acting upon their solicitor’s opinion, supported
the Liverpool officers in their refusal to grant
the registry. The Company then moved for a mandamus
in the Court of Queen’s Bench; and, after the
usual proceedings in such cases, it was decided by
the Court that as the Company applied for registration
in its corporate capacity, the Court could not
take notice of its constituent members, whether they
were actually foreigners or not; or, in other words,
that an English Incorporated Company was a British
subject for the purposes of the Registry Act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
details:
owner to
reside in
the
United
Kingdom.</div>

<p>The result of this remarkable decision was that
foreigners, when incorporated, could own a ship, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
not individually. In an extreme case, a ship might,
ultimately, become the sole property of foreigners
exclusively, and yet be entitled to be registered as
a British ship, as a corporate body remains permanently.
So that the law created the curious anomaly
that a foreigner could not have a share in a British
vessel, but might be the owner of all the shares of
a corporate body which owned, for instance, the
<i>Great Eastern</i>. Another difficulty arose with reference
to the residence in or out of England of the
owner of a ship. The Free-trade party contended
that if a foreigner were disposed to come here and
build a ship, there was no disadvantage either to
British shipbuilders or British shipowners, or British
sailors, especially as he could hold all the shares of a
ship. On the other hand, it was contended that this
was an extreme case, not likely often to occur, and the
principle, if acted upon, of allowing individual ownership,
might give considerable power to foreigners
to the prejudice of British subjects; in fact, that the
violation of this principle went to the very basis of
the Navigation Law, which it would destroy. To
such a point was real British ownership carried out,
that, as the Act required owners of British ships to
reside in the United Kingdom, the owner of a British
registered ship, if he resided at Paris,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> would lose
his privileges as such.</p>

<p>Other difficulties arose from the indefinite character
of the law: thus, gin could be brought into
England, but brandy could not, in <i>any</i> foreign ships.
American vessels could not bring corn from Holland;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>while, on the other hand, American corn landed in
Holland could not be brought to England in a
Bremen ship; and these difficulties were, in the case
of corn, considerably increased by the difficulty of
pronouncing upon the actual origin of the corn, as
none but the most experienced dealers in grain could
decide such a question, and, even with them, it must
often have been mere guess work. A case occurred in
which timber from Memel was sent to British North
America, and, afterwards, brought to England at the
low differential duty then existing. The law, at that
time, permitted the produce of British possessions
abroad to be imported, without its being described
as <i>the produce</i> of those possessions; a tolerated evasion,
it is clear, of the Navigation Law. But in the case
of a ship arriving from Hayti, bringing a cargo of
Haytian produce, the master described his ship as a
Swedish ship, there being, in point of fact, no Haytian
ships. In this case, the goods were liable to
forfeiture; but they were allowed to be warehoused
for exportation, and the vessel was permitted to
depart. A Swedish ship was clearly inadmissible
under the 16th Section of the Navigation Act.</p>

of
goods
brought to
Europe.</div>

<p>Perhaps one of the greatest absurdities attending
the practical working of the Navigation Law was
that which related to the “naturalisation” of goods,
the produce of Asia, Africa, and America, which,
when once landed in Europe, were, by this Act, not
admissible into the ports of Great Britain, even in
British ships, for home consumption.</p>

<p>Two remarkable cases came under my own experience,
so curiously illustrative of the laxity and
stringency of the law respectively, as to deserve especial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
notice. In the first case, thirty-five casks of annatto,
the produce of Cayenne, a French colony, were
in course of transit in a French ship to Bordeaux.
This valuable dye could have been brought <i>direct</i> from
Cayenne in a British ship for home consumption to
England; but, if once brought from the French colony
in a French ship, and <i>landed</i> in Europe, it was clearly
inadmissible under the clause, “that goods, the produce
of Asia, Africa, and America, shall not be
imported from Europe into the United Kingdom to
be used therein.”</p>

<p>The value of annatto is apt to fluctuate suddenly
from very low to enormously high prices, just as
the fashion for the colour varies. Annatto on this
occasion rose to a high price; and a London agent,
knowing that thirty-five casks of it were on their
way to Europe, set his wits to work to bring this
French colonial produce into a port in England,
in spite of the Navigation Laws. The agent was
thoroughly acquainted with every branch of the
law, and asked himself what constituted <i>a landing in</i>
Europe? Having satisfied himself on this point, he
arranged with an eminent house at Bordeaux to purchase
the annatto for arrival, land the cotton, which
constituted the chief part of the cargo, and charter a
small vessel, and send on the annatto to London in
this <i>British ship</i>. This was done; and, when the
vessel was on the point of arrival, he sought the
Commissioners of Customs, and frankly avowed his
proceedings. Mr. Dean, one of the chief officers, admitted
that, many years previously, especially during
the war in 1810, similar transhipments had been
allowed, under the authority of the officers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
Crown,—a mere transhipment, and certain formalities
performed at the French Customs, not being
“a landing in Europe,”—and the thirty-five casks
of annatto were admitted at a profit to the partners
of nearly 3000<i>l.</i><a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Waste of
capital
caused
thereby,</div>

<p>In the second case, the rigour of the law led to the
greatest absurdity. About the year 1839, the price
of coffee was very high in the London market, while
large quantities of the finest Java and Dutch colonial
coffee were warehoused in store in Amsterdam. This
produce was clearly inadmissible under the clause
already quoted, having been, beyond all dispute,
“landed in Europe.” In what way could this coffee
be brought into the London market in the teeth of
the existing stringent Navigation Laws? The same
agent, who represented one of the oldest Dutch houses,
contracted to deliver a cargo of Dutch coffee at a
given price at a distant period. He then chartered a
British ship, which he sent to Amsterdam, took in
a cargo of coffee, and the ship thus laden with Dutch
colonial produce was sent to the Cape of Good Hope.
At that colony the coffee was landed, or, at all events,
was supposed to be landed, fresh papers were made
out, and the coffee consigned to London as “naturalised”
produce, and, coming direct from a British
colony in a British ship, was, of course, admissible for
home consumption. To despatch many thousand tons
of coffee and other produce half across the globe from
Europe, for no other purpose than to be brought
back again, in order to comply with the rigorous
provisions of the old Navigation Laws, which, in point
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>of fact, were nullified as regards goods, while the
shipowners alone reaped the advantage of this useless
and protracted voyage, was surely a climax of absurdity!
Nevertheless, it is within my own personal
experience that a large amount of business was transacted
in this way, all the expenses incurred being, in
an economical point of view, a total waste of capital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and obstructions
to trade.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Story of
the
cochineal.</div>

<p>Again, on the part of the old law, the want of
adaptability to the changing conditions of different
markets was often a serious difficulty. Thus, it often
happened that the state of these markets in different
parts of the world presented favourable mercantile
prospects; but no suitable vessel could be found to
carry the goods to the market where they were required.
For instance, hostilities being about to break
out between France and the United States in 1834,
the price of French brandy rose enormously in America,
while, at the same time, the large quantities of
that article then in England rendered it unsaleable in
the London market. At the time there was not an
American vessel to be chartered in the Thames,
and the American Navigation Laws precluded the
brandy from being carried in a British vessel. On
the other hand, palm-oil, at times, could not be
brought from the United States, there being no British
vessel available for charter on the spot. In such
cases, the merchants complained in their letters in
doleful terms, “I have lost my commission, and some
British vessel the freight.” Instances of such occurrences
were multiplied from all parts of the world.
Much was said at the time about the difficulty of bringing
cochineal from the Canary Islands, where the
cactus, on which it feeds, had recently been cultivated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
for this purpose. Though it might be absurd to raise
such complaints, as the smallest possible inconvenience
resulted from the state of the law as it affected this
particular article, the principle applied to the whole
colonial system; and, as Spain refused to allow British
ships to carry British goods to the Canaries, it was
urged that our colonial system ought to be altered, so
as to induce Spain to modify hers. Cochineal produced
in the Canaries, and landed at Cadiz in Europe, like
other articles, had to be sent elsewhere out of Europe
to be naturalised, in order to come in for home consumption.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But the
Navigation
Laws
not always
to blame.</div>

<p>Perhaps, practically, these anomalies did not, to any
large extent, occasion impediments to business beyond
retarding its extension, because every merchant was
so well acquainted with the provisions of the Navigation
Laws (which were as much studied for their
evasion as otherwise), that less inconvenience resulted<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
than might have been expected. The law,
however, assumed so many complex forms with time,
new discoveries, treaty obligations, and perpetual
minor alterations, that, irrespectively of the advantages
or disadvantages of a total change, arguments
could be raised for a complete abrogation of every
existing Act, if it were only to commence anew and
remodel the law, so as to avoid the habitual and
vexatious discussions and disputes with the Customs
to which the system gave rise.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Special
views of
the Canadians.</div>

<p>As regarded the operation of the Navigation Laws
with reference to Canada, it was far more complicated
than even that between the mother-country, her colonies
in the West Indies, and the United States. While
some of the shipowners of England had, as we have
seen, gone so far as even to demand protection against
the shipping of English colonists, the Canadians were
busily occupied with efforts in an entirely opposite
direction. They were not inclined, by a system of
protection, to force their trade in any particular
channel: for, so far as regarded the carrying-trade of
the North-Western American States, the Canadians
obviously could only secure its passage through their
territory by holding out superior advantages in the
way of cheapness of transit. For this purpose they
had already done everything that great enterprise
and expenditure could accomplish. They succeeded
as far as possible; and, at length, possessed a line of
communication at once more rapid and more cheap
from the interior to the sea than any existing in the
United States. The whole question then was confined
to the comparative advantages of shipment
from Quebec or Montreal, or from New York. If
those ports could be nearly equalised in respect to
freights to England, Canada would succeed in her
object; if the disparity continued as it did then, all
her efforts would have been unavailing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Montreal,
its shipping
and
trade.</div>

<p>It was, generally, represented that the high rate of
freight between Montreal and the United Kingdom
was owing to the limited number of ships employed
in the import trade of Canada. In the spring and
latter end of the summer, ships, composing what was
called the spring and fall fleet, arrived; and, so long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
as they were in port wanting freight, the rate was
comparatively moderate; but in the interval, being
the middle of summer, when most of the western
produce arrived for shipment, an inferior class of
ships only were at hand, which delivered their
cargoes in bad condition, and, at the same time,
charged exorbitant rates, according to the quantity
of produce for shipment. The rate of freight is said
to have fluctuated in Montreal in one and the same
season between 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per barrel; and it
is stated that the higher rate, from 6<i>s.</i> to 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per
barrel, had been paid in Montreal, while freights were
offered in foreign ships at New York as low as 1<i>s.</i>
and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per barrel; indeed, at this time, an offer
of 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per barrel extra would have brought any
number of ships round from the American sea-ports,
but the Navigation Laws interposed. It was clearly
seen that such fluctuations in the rates of freight,
together with the employment of inferior vessels,
could not have occurred were the Canadian merchants
able to select in the American ports such
ships as were seeking freight to Europe.</p>

<p>During the temporary suspension of the Navigation
Laws in 1847, twenty-two ships arrived from
Bremen at the port of Montreal laden with emigrants
intended for the United States, that route being chosen
as easier and cheaper. These ships on their return
took cargoes for the United Kingdom; and it was
evident that, if the same facilities were continued,
the great German emigration to the United States
would to some extent pass through Canada. This
was but one instance of many which might be reasonably
expected, if foreign vessels could resort to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
Canadian ports. These ships were well fitted for
the carriage of wheat and flour; and the competition
produced by their presence would not only tend to
reduce the freight from Canada to an equality with
those from the States, but the good condition of the
cargoes delivered would be assured; the shippers
would, in this way, be saved from the use of inferior
vessels, the damage caused by which was thought
not to be over-estimated at an average of five per
cent. on such shipments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Navigation
of the
St.
Lawrence.</div>

<p>Again: the American merchants of the West were
anxious to avail themselves of the facilities afforded
by the River St. Lawrence. Thus, if their vessels
were permitted to come down to Montreal and
Quebec, there to meet American or foreign ships to
take their cargoes on freight to Europe or elsewhere,
it was naturally thought that an extensive
and profitable commerce through Canada would
immediately follow; the lower ports, by these means,
at once assuming the position, as commercial depôts,
to which their geographical position on that great
river outlet of Northern America seemed to entitle
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Free-trade
with the
United
States
desired by
the farmers
of Canada.</div>

<p>Connected with this important subject of the free
navigation of the St. Lawrence west of Quebec,
which the Americans were desirous of procuring, a
corresponding desire prevailed on the part of the
Canadian farmers to avail themselves of the American
home market, whenever it offered superior prices
to those derived from exportation to Europe. The
price of wheat and flour in the Eastern States, required
for home consumption, was often much higher
than the price in Canada for exportation, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
this happened, it would obviously have been greatly
to the advantage of the Canadian agriculturist if he
could have exported his produce to the United States.
This he was prevented from doing by a protective
duty of a quarter of a dollar per bushel upon wheat.
Efforts had been made in the United States to abolish
this duty; but the advocates of its abolition were
constantly defeated by the Protection cries of the
American farmers, or by a difficulty as to the “most
favoured” nation-clause in treaties with Foreign
Powers, the more so, as a relaxation in favour of
Canada was, naturally, capable of extension to any or
all nations with whom the United States had such
treaties subsisting. Here is a clear instance how
commercial treaties, even of a liberal character, become
as much “entangling alliances” as the political
conventions of “amity and friendship” have so
frequently been. Indeed, the “favoured” nation-clause,
however well intended and beneficial in the
highest degree in certain cases, has often been a
source of dispute to those States who either have
accepted or enforced it, and, even more so, to those
countries which have been compelled to adopt it.
The interests of great nations vary so much at
different periods that inflexible rules in politics or
commerce must frequently operate very prejudicially,
and cannot be maintained with entire consistency
for the true interests of the commonwealth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations
proposed.</div>

<p>It was thought that if the free navigation of the St.
Lawrence were offered to the American Government
in return for the abolition of the protecting duty, one
measure to be co-existent with the other, Congress
would be inclined to abolish the protective duty;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
while the abolition, being a matter of reciprocal
arrangement, all difficulty arising from the commercial
relations of the United States with foreign countries
might thus be avoided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Canadians
urge the
abolition
of Protection.</div>

<p>The more advanced section of the Free-trade party
of Canada pressed this proposal on the executive
government, together with the abolition of all protection
conferred by the Navigation Laws, which it
was asserted was, after all, purely nominal, and only
to secure other advantages. They pronounced the
so-called Protection to be in its effects upon Canada
practically mischievous, contending that, if the trade
was nearer from Canadian waters to the canals and
ports of the United States, British shipowners would
have to compete with foreigners in the ports of that
country; that, if they could do this successfully there,
they could do so in the Canadian ports; but if not,
under existing circumstances, the trade of Canada
could not afford to maintain a mere legal monopoly:
moreover, if the supposed Protection only led to the
desertion of the cities and sea-ports of Canada, without
subserving the interests of British shipowners, it was
hoped that useless restrictions, irreconcilable with
the withdrawal of protective duties in the United
States in favour of Canadian produce, would be at
once removed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Views of
Western
Canada.</div>

<p>The Canadians could not indeed fail to perceive,
when the question was raised in the mother-country,
that a great portion of the exportable produce of
Western Canada, probably by far the greater part,
was at that very moment on its way to ports in the
United States; that little was expected at Montreal;
that the canals constructed on the St. Lawrence were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
almost idle; that importing ships coming to Montreal
were without their usual full freight; that the principal
importations into Western Canada were effected
through the United States; and that the trade
of the city of Montreal was in consequence rapidly
decreasing. On the other hand, they observed the
greatly-increasing consumption and importation into
their country of articles formerly imported wholly
through that port. Hence they inferred, that the
opening of Canadian sea-ports to vessels of all nations,
with permission to send colonial produce to England
in any vessels, as well as the opening the River
St. Lawrence above Quebec to Americans, would
probably restore trade to its original channel, and
increase the commerce and revenues of Canada beyond
precedent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Canadians
really only
for partial
Free-trade.</div>

<p>Such were the hopes entertained by the Canadians
of a modification in the restrictive system. But even
the boldest of their Free-traders shrunk for a time from
the notion of an unconditional surrender of the natural
advantages the navigation of the St. Lawrence conferred
upon Canada. Hence they proposed to themselves
to reserve their full rights, and confined their
advocacy to such changes in the law relating to navigating
the St. Lawrence above Quebec as would enable
them to make terms with the Americans. They had
then no idea of throwing open to foreigners generally
the use of their great rivers without an ample equivalent:
they contented themselves with asking for
powers from the Imperial Legislature to enable them
to negotiate from time to time on the subject, and to
make the navigation of the river a matter of treaty
and regulation; preserving their own sovereignty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
with power to resume the exclusive use of it at the
conclusion of any agreement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Improvements
of
their internal
navigation.</div>

<p>Hitherto the enterprise and energies of the
colonies had been almost exclusively directed to
the important objects of improving the internal
navigation of the St. Lawrence from Lake Erie
to Quebec, so as to place it in such a state of
cheapness and efficiency as would make that route
more advantageous as a port of embarkation for a
sea voyage than any route through the United
States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Welland
Canal.</div>

<p>In the case of the Welland Canal, Canadians
could not fail to perceive that the passage of American
vessels down and up had contributed to render it
profitable. Indeed, the Welland Canal was used extensively
by American vessels, as it was a short communication
between the two great lakes, and, at the
same time, admitted of the passage of large vessels,
which, instead of entering the American Erie Canal
at Buffalo, proceeded down Lake Ontario to Oswego,
where goods are transferred to the canal-boats for
transport to New York. In this way a large portion
of the revenue from the Welland Canal was derived
from the American trade, arising from the free navigation
of a part of the internal waters of Canada,
and thus Western Canada enjoyed the benefit of a
navigation supported to a considerable extent by
foreign commerce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cost of
freight the
real
question.</div>

<p>It was observed, further, that, if products from
the Western States could be transported to the
sea more cheaply through Canada than through
America, the Canadian route would of course be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
preferred, and thus the Canadian canals would engross
the carrying trade of the North-Western
States of America. But if, on the other hand,
the advantage of the perfect inland navigation was
more than counterbalanced by the rates of freight
from Quebec and Montreal to Europe, the people
of Western Canada, having no protection in the
English markets by using the Canadian lines of
communication, would send the whole of their produce
by way of New York, and import such
articles of foreign consumption as they required by
the same route.</p>

<p>So long as the colony enjoyed Protection in the
British market no injury to its commerce could arise,
because the extent of the protection was generally
sufficient to prevent the owners from divesting the
Canadian produce of its British character, and it
could not become available for the home market of
America, unless on the payment of a heavy duty.
Even with regard to American produce, the provision
in the old Corn Law giving to American wheat
and flour the same protection as Canadian if exported
through Canada, with the payment of 3<i>s.</i> per
quarter duty in the province, was, at most times, a
sufficient inducement for many Americans to make
shipments to Montreal, as well as for the Canadians
to make purchases in the United States. When,
however, by the repeal of the Corn Laws all protection
was removed, the question became one of
mere cheapness of transport; and taking an average
of the preceding four years, the difference in freight
was no less than 3<i>s.</i> per barrel of flour in favour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
of New York over Montreal.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Even when the benefits
enjoyed by Canada in her internal navigation,
estimated at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per barrel, were deducted, there
would still remain in favour of New York, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
on each barrel of flour—an advantage quite sufficient
to turn the whole export trade into that
channel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loss to
Canada by
New York
line.</div>

<p>As the United States then admitted the transit of
Canadian produce through their territory, the loss it
encountered at New York arose from the necessity of
complying with the Navigation Laws, which forbade
its being imported into England in foreign ships
(8 &amp; 9 Vict., cap. 88, sect. 4). At the same time, it
must, also, be noticed that, as freight in British ships
from New York to England was no higher than the
freight in American ships, this restriction, confessedly,
had no appreciable influence on the question of transmission
through Canada or the United States.</p>

<p>For some time, previously, the import trade of
Western Canada, which, by means of protecting
duties in favour of British ships and British goods,
was forced to come by the St. Lawrence, had been
changing its direction, and Montreal, which supplied
the whole western country, was becoming deserted
by the western merchants. The new Customs Law
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>of that province, while it equalised duties, enabled
the consumer to purchase in the cheapest market, and,
thus, vastly increased the evil to former importing
cities; hence, a very large proportion of the export
trade also of Canada had now taken the direction of
New York. There was, therefore, naturally a serious
apprehension, lest the great public works of the
St. Lawrence would cease to be useful and profitable,
and, that the commercial connection so many years
existing between Western and Eastern Canada would
thus be altogether cut off.</p>

<p>It has been unnecessary to refer to the export trade
in timber from Canada, as this stood on exceptional
grounds. Indeed, a general opinion prevailed that
the export of timber from Quebec would probably be
carried on, under any circumstances, in British ships
specially employed in that branch of trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
summary
of results
as to
Canada.</div>

<p>From these important considerations it was concluded:—</p>

<p>1st. That, as Canada then enjoyed but a remnant of
Protection in England, she ought to be released from
any restrictions <i>for the benefit of the shipowner</i>.</p>

<p>2nd. That, without the free navigation of the St.
Lawrence and a repeal of the Navigation Laws so
far as British North American Colonies were concerned,
there was reason to apprehend that New
York would become the emporium of the trade of
Canada, and further, that, thus, a community of interests,
commercial and political, would be created
with the United States.</p>

<p>3rd. That, in such a case, the repeal of these laws
would not materially injure the British shipowner,
the question simply being whether competition for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
trade should take place in the harbours of the United
States or in the River St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>Lastly, That the repeal of these laws would have
a tendency to perpetuate, and not to destroy, the
relations existing between Canada and the mother-country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">West
Indians
for Free-trade
as
well as Canadians.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Divergent
views of
capitalists
at home.</div>

<p>For these reasons, an organisation of merchants in
Montreal, and in various towns in Canada, who had
leagued themselves as Free-traders and had been very
active in disseminating their views, as well as in
enforcing them, with all the influence they could
command, on the colonial Governor, and on the
English Executive and both Houses of Parliament,
now demanded the total repeal of the British Navigation
Laws. They did not, however, stand alone
in their desire for unrestricted navigation. The
West Indies, as soon as they found that the British
Parliament had taken away the protection afforded
to them by the differential duties, were as loud in
their complaints as the Canadians, the more so, as
having been deprived of all protection on their sugars
by Lord John Russell’s Equalization Act of 1847, it
became indispensable to get their produce conveyed
to market at the cheapest possible rate of freight, so
as to compete, with any chance of success, with their
foreign rivals. They therefore denounced the Navigation
Laws in no measured terms; and when Montreal
petitioned that its corn should be admitted into
the ports of Great Britain in ships of any nation
their merchants thought proper to charter, the West
Indians preferred the same request, in order to secure
the lowest cost of transport for their sugar. While,
therefore, the colonists were urging the adoption of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
principle of an entire free trade with the colonies,
many capitalists of England, and, especially, the shipowners,
viewed with great alarm the total abandonment
of what was known as our “colonial system,”
and declared their apprehension that such a change
would throw the carrying trade into the hands of the
United States. Clinging to Protection, they said, in
their memorials to Parliament, “that the only remaining
thing connected with our whole important
and most magnificent colonial system, which enabled
us to baffle the efforts of the whole world united
against us, was that part of the system under which
the produce of the colonies was obliged to be brought
to this country in British ships.” These alarmists declared
that such a relaxation as the colonists now
demanded would ruin them inevitably. Regarding
every concession which had been made to the Americans
during the preceding half century, having as
it had for its object increased intercourse with the
West Indies, as a pernicious policy, tending to injure
British colonies and to encourage American trade,
they alleged that the protection of the colonies had
not been carried far enough; that British shipowners
could not exist without Protection; that the uncertainty
prevailing with respect to the Navigation
Laws was productive of injury to the country, as
no persons would embark capital in shipping; and,
further, that, as regarded the West Indies, it was
not the <i>general</i> wish of the colonists that the Navigation
Laws should be repealed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Views of
Manchester
and
Liverpool.</div>

<p>In this controversy, the important cities of Manchester
and Liverpool each took also a very different
view. The great Free-traders of the former desired the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
unconditional repeal of the Navigation Laws, feeling
convinced that their cotton and corn would then be
brought to them at cheaper rates, and that they
would be able to deliver to much greater advantage
in distant markets the products of their manufacturers;
but the shipowners of Liverpool, almost as a
body (though there were a few important exceptions),
were exceedingly adverse to any material change in
these laws, as they regarded with great and natural
jealousy the then triumphant progress of American
shipping.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55" class="label">[55]</a> I give this clause at length, because it is about the first step
towards a change in our Navigation Laws, which had become necessary
to render them practicable, after steam had been introduced for the

which I shall have a great deal to say hereafter, drove itself through
numerous Acts of Parliament, and showed how vain were legislative
measures when opposed to the progress of science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Witnesses
examined
by Mr.
Ricardo’s
Committee.</div>

<p>Having now laid before my readers the substance of
the state of the Navigation Laws at the time of the
appointment of Mr. Ricardo’s Committee in February
1847, I shall proceed to state generally the
principal facts put forth by the leading witnesses on
the side of the Free-traders and of the Protectionists
respectively.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. J. S.
Lefevre.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Macgregor.</div>

<p>On the side of the former, Mr. John S. Lefevre, Mr.
Macgregor, and Mr. G. R. Porter, officers of the Board
of Trade, and decidedly inclined to the total repeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
of the Navigation Laws, were the chief witnesses
brought forward to make out a case against the existing
system. Of these, the first—a distinguished
mathematician as well as a lawyer of sound learning—was
eminently fitted to work out, calmly and dispassionately,
the intricate points connected with the
complex system then prevalent. The other two were
strong partisans. Mr. Macgregor, a somewhat superficial
person, gave the most off-hand answers to questions,
though profoundly ignorant of their tendency,
therein committing the most egregious blunders, and
urging many inaccuracies about the Reciprocity
Treaties, their effect on commerce, and the injury
Great Britain had sustained through her ancient
Navigation Laws. On the question of the maritime
relations between this country and the United States,
Mr. Macgregor gave evidence, also, at great length, a
considerable portion of which was, however, erroneous
as to matters of fact, while many of his conclusions
were fallacious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. G. R.
Porter.</div>

<p>Mr. G. R. Porter, Secretary of the Statistical
Department, and well known as entertaining the
strongest convictions that the Navigation Laws were
as injurious to the shipowners themselves as they
had been to the nation, was an industrious hard-working
man, but he was at the same time committed
by many previous publications to the most
extreme opinions on Free-trade: of real practical
commerce he had no experience. Mr. Porter had,
however, studied the whole question with care, and,
while enthusiastic in favour of an entire change,
and sanguine with regard to the beneficial results
to follow from the repeal of these laws, he gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
strong and valid reasons for his bold opinions. Their
repeal, he showed, would tend, materially, to develop
and increase the warehousing system of Great
Britain, making it, in fact, a vast depôt for supplying
the wants of the people of all nations. Not
that the existing laws presented any impediment
to warehousing goods, but that facilities would
be afforded for making advances on foreign produce
by the removal of restrictions. In answer to
numerous and varied questions from those members
of the Committee who were opposed to his views,
he gave a clear and decided opinion that the trade
of England had not been benefited in any one of
its branches, shipowning included, by the Navigation
Laws: and he could not for a moment admit
that these laws had operated beneficially even for the
“encouragement of a commercial marine.” He rested
his arguments on the economical principle that the
shipping trade of this country, as a trade, could be
conducted on no other principles than those whereby
trade, generally, was carried on; he contended that
no more ships would be built than it was expected
would be required, so as to yield a profit to the
persons who built them; that, in the long run,
there could be no larger amount of profit derived
from shipowning than from any other trade, as
other persons would, of course, come in to share the
profit with the existing shipowners; and that, unless
shipping yielded the ordinary rate of profit to be derived
from the commerce of the country, deficiencies
in shipping from losses would not be, from time to
time, supplied. It was well known, he remarked,
that the trade of the country had gone on increasing;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
that, from year to year, more ships had
been built; and, further, that, though shipowners
had certainly been at times loud in their complaints
and fears as to their future prospects, they had still
continually added to the amount of their tonnage.
Mr. Porter then put in the strongest light the groundless
fears they had so long entertained by quoting their
Report for 1833,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> wherein they state that “the long-continued
and still existing depression of the shipping
interest, the partial production, and great aggravation
of distress caused by continual changes in our
navigation system; the utter impossibility of the
successful maintenance of an unrestricted competition
with foreign navigation; the gross injustice of the
imposition of peculiar and exclusive burdens on maritime
commerce for purposes purely national, while
exposed to that competition; the declining quality
and estimation of British tonnage; the embarrassment,
decay, and ruin of the British shipowner, may
now be viewed as incontrovertible positions.” In
reply to this desponding statement, Mr. Porter directed
attention to the official returns, showing that in
1833 the amount of British tonnage on the register
was 2,634,577 tons, whereas in 1846 it was no less
than 3,817,112 tons, an increase of 1,182,535 tons.
So that, to the melancholy “facts” of the shipowners
in 1833, Mr. Porter opposed his prosperous
“figures” of 1846. Such discordant views could not
by any means be reconciled; but shipowners of all
countries and in all ages have ever had the most
evil forebodings on the subject of the withdrawal of
protection.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>
<p>Mr. Porter did not fail to hold out the threat that
Prussia, at the head of the Zollverein States of Germany,
would still further carry out its restrictive
principles, and impose differential duties on foreign
shipping; and that Hamburg and Bremen were, at
that time, deliberating whether they should join the
Zollverein under one flag, as far as concerned shipping.
He, nevertheless, expressed the most sanguine
hopes that, when foreign nations discovered beyond
all doubt, that England was advancing in the path of
Free-trade, they would gladly follow her example,
and that commerce throughout the whole of Europe
and the world would be unshackled.</p>

<p>It appeared, further, from his evidence, that Mr.
Porter was for a complete abrogation of the English
Navigation Laws, without any reservations as to
reciprocity, and that, from the general conviction that
these restrictive laws were rather injurious than
beneficial to us, independently of the policy of other
nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their extreme
views not
conclusive
to the
Committee.</div>

<p>It cannot, however, be said that, in 1847, the repeal
party had succeeded in convincing the majority of
even the Committee of the soundness of their opinions.
The shipowners, as a body, endeavoured to
controvert, and with considerable show of success
for the time, the theories propounded by the Free-trade
party, so strenuously supported by the officers
of the Board of Trade. The cold imperturbable evidence
of Mr. (now Sir) John Shaw Lefevre, who was
intimately connected with the Free-trade party, contrasted
strikingly with the impetuosity of such men
as Mr. Macgregor, and even with the testimony of
Mr. Porter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
adduced
by the
shipowners.</div>

<p>The shipowners, on the other hand, put forward
their most practical and intelligent witnesses<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> to prove
that the repeal of the Navigation Laws would cause
an immediate depreciation of thirty per cent. in the
value of their property, and of shipping, generally,
throughout the United Kingdom; that, if the British
shipowner were deprived of his privileges, already
greatly curtailed by the system of reciprocity, it would
be decidedly to his advantage to invest his capital in
foreign ships, and to navigate them by foreign seamen:
Englishmen, they alleged, would own, in conjunction
with foreigners (if possible), foreign ships, in
order to secure the privileges still attaching to foreign
flags, since British ships would still be excluded from
many foreign ports, even though the Navigation Laws
were abrogated. It was shown, as they conceived
incontestably, that a ship could be built at Dantzig
at a much less cost than in England,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and that, if the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>foreign trade were thrown open without restriction,
no one would think of building British ships; the
result being, that a great number of persons dependent
on shipping—shipwrights and others—must be
thrown out of employment, with great general distress
ensuing. The difficulty of manning the Royal
Navy, under such untoward circumstances (a standard
argument), was, of course, dwelt on with great
force as an unmitigated national evil. It was further
urged, that the relaxation of the laws, so far as to
allow Asiatic and African produce to be admitted
to Great Britain for home consumption from ports
in Europe, in all bottoms, must deprive the British
shipowner of his most valuable privilege, and destroy
the very essence of the ancient law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ships built
more
cheaply
abroad.</div>

<p>The argument, that these laws ought to be abrogated
in the interests of the consumer was met by
the counter-assertion, that any difference of freight,
if such indeed existed, would make no appreciable
difference in the price of consumable articles. Even
the excessively high freight of 8<i>s.</i> per barrel from
the United States, which had been paid on an
emergency, would, they held, amount to only one
halfpenny per pound on the flour, so that when
freight was reduced to its usual rate, a very slight
increase of value was the consequence. The witnesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
against repeal spoke of various other articles<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> in a
similar manner, arguing that the reduction would be
so small that it could never reach the consumer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
of Mr. G.
F. Young,</div>

<p>Of all the witnesses examined before the Committee,
no one was more opposed to the repeal than
Mr. George Frederick Young, a shipbuilder and shipowner
in the port of London. He was quite as strong
a partisan in favour of leaving things as they were
as Mr. Ricardo and Mr. Porter were in favour of
Free-trade. He would admit no further innovations
of any kind, contending, that, even the reciprocity
system had been in the highest degree detrimental
to the interests of the British shipowners: indeed,
he asserted that if the Navigation Laws were repealed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>it would be seen that the interests of the
merchants would be quite as much compromised as
those of shipowners, as it was under the operation
of these laws that importations were so largely
directed into the emporium of England. He apprehended
that this repeal would substitute certain
conveniently-located foreign ports as depôts for imported
produce for the supply of England, in lieu
of British ports. He fortified this opinion by elaborate
calculations, showing an enormous difference
in the warehousing charges at Amsterdam,
Rotterdam, and Hamburg, leading, as he apprehended,
to this inevitable conclusion, that a British
merchant would find it more to his interest to establish
depôts at those places, than to import commodities
for the supply of his own country, to be
lodged in the St. Katherine or West India Docks, or
in other similar establishments.</p>

<p>With regard to the subject of the Whale Fisheries,
and the way in which they might be affected by a
repeal of the Navigation Laws, Mr. Young pointed
out that the trade of the northern and southern
fisheries had been for many years past a declining
one: but this decline, he said, though in a great
degree traceable to other causes, received an accelerated
impetus from the course pursued by the Legislature
in discouraging these trades, while the Americans,
on the other hand, had received from their
Legislature every possible support. So far as regards
the relative cost of navigating British ships,
Mr. Young brought forward a mass of figures<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>purpose of showing that the difference in every case
was in favour of foreign shipowners, but more especially
in the case of those of the United States,
Holland, the Hanse Towns, Sweden, and Prussia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and his
general
conclusions.</div>

<p>By the various reciprocity treaties Mr. Young considered
the Navigation Laws were virtually repealed
with regard to those countries with whom we had
concluded such conventions: but, while maintaining
that these treaties had proved highly prejudicial to
Great Britain, he did not recommend a retrograde
policy; and we gladly admit that, whatever opinions
might be entertained of the ardent Protectionist principles
he propounded, his political adversaries bore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
full testimony to the ability with which he advocated
his cause during the days he was under examination,
and to the large amount of practical knowledge
he brought to bear on the subject. He displayed,
too, great tact, and, I must add, great
patriotism, viewing the contemplated change in the
light he did, when he wound up his evidence by
asserting, unequivocally, that the Navigation Laws
were framed for the paramount and political purpose
of assisting in the defence of this country, as well
as for encouraging maritime commerce; that these
objects, in his judgment, could never have been
obtained and maintained without these great Acts;
and that he fully and completely declared his concurrence
in the opinion given by Adam Smith,
which we have already quoted. “I have no hesitation
in declaring,” remarked Mr. Young, in concluding
his evidence, “my perfect conviction, that
it has been, through the operation of our navigation
system entirely, that the maritime power
of this country has been raised to its present
height, that the country has been defended, and
all the evils which would have resulted from its
being made the seat of war have been providentially
averted.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Richmond’s
evidence.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Asserts
that shipping
is a
losing
trade.</div>

<p>As considerable uneasiness had been felt by those
who advocated the policy of Protection with reference
to the competition which might be anticipated from
the shipping of the three Hanse Towns—Lubeck,
Bremen, and Hamburg—although on inquiry it was
shown that the whole tonnage of sea-going ships
belonging to these ports was only about 150,000 tons
register, it is advisable here to refer to the testimony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
of Mr. William Richmond, who was deputed by the
shipowners of the borough of Tynemouth to appear
before the Committee.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> This gentleman had been a
shipowner for nearly fifty years, and, at his advanced
age, was reluctant to appear: but zeal for a cause to
which he had devoted great energy during a long
life, together with the importance of the subject, induced
him to come forward to rescue, so far as he
could, the shipowners from “impending destruction.”
It is unnecessary, however, here to follow him
through his elaborate history of the Navigation
Laws, but, as an exponent of the views of many
shipowners in the north of England, the points he
urged most strongly ought not to be overlooked.
Strange, however, to say, his first contention was
that, for the preceding twenty-five years, the shipping
trade had been a losing one, those employed in
the Baltic during the whole of that time having made
no money whatever. When, naturally, he was asked
to explain how it had come to pass that a losing
trade should be so long maintained, Mr. Richmond
entered into details, which, though not satisfying the
Committee as to the whole force of his assertion,
threw considerable light on the actual state of the
merchant shipping at that period.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Replies to
charges
against
the ship
owners.</div>

<p>It had been charged against shipowners, as we
have seen,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> that their ships were unseaworthy, while
the masters had been condemned in no measured
terms. These accusations he indignantly repelled;
his explanation as to the permanence of a losing
trade being substantially this—that a distinct class
of men existed who were shipowners, and not
merchants, whose fathers had been shipowners
for successive generations, and had left them ships
as their only inheritance; and that, as they could
not readily divest themselves of this property, and
had no means of buying ships of an improved description
fit to compete with vessels of more modern
date,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> their commercial career generally ended with
the Gazette.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Views as
to captains
of merchant
ships.</div>

<p>With regard to the qualifications of captains of
merchant vessels, Mr. Richmond said that sixty years
ago, when he went to sea, very young in life, it was
customary for respectable and even wealthy people,
in the maritime districts, to send their children
to sea: indeed, no matter whether they were shipowners
or merchants, agriculturists or manufacturers,
one of the family was sent to sea, because it was considered
a line in which there was a fair chance of
prospering. “But no respectable people send their
children to sea now,” he exclaimed, “as it is a profession
which, in all probability, would lead them to
beggary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Praises
their
nautical
skill and
capacity.</div>

<p>In nautical skill, Mr. Richmond held the British
captain of the present day fully equal to the captain
of former days; while he, also, thought, that the ruder
the man, on his admission into the hardy profession
he was to adopt, the more advantageous it might be
to him, at least in the discharge of the rougher part
of his professional duties. In the pursuit of freights
abroad, on the “seeking system,” these captains, he
admitted, might be inferior to some continental captains;
but the business of chartering a ship belonged
more strictly to the shipbroker; the captain, in his
opinion, being in a relation not unlike that of the
driver of a coach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His character
of
common
seamen.</div>

<p>With regard to British seamen, he considered that
they, like all other classes, had become more temperate
of late years, but were always less a spirit-drinking
people than the Germans. The bad
accommodation for the common sailor on board
merchant ships might destroy his comforts, but
not his morals; and honourable testimony had been
given by an American captain,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> that he would prefer
the English seaman to any in the world, even
to Americans. Every person, he thought, must
concur with him in the opinion that our seamen
were, what they had ever been, “a danger-defying,
skilful, thoughtless, improvident, and perhaps a turbulent
race:” and Mr. Richmond appealed confidently
to Admiral Dundas, who sat on the Committee,
whether he would not rather go into action
with 100 British seamen than 200 seamen of any
other nation?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attacks
Mr.
Porter.</div>

<p>It is unnecessary to enter into the details of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>elaborate and curious tables<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Mr. Richmond prepared
to show that there were as many ships as formerly,
and that their increase had kept pace with the
population between 1816 and 1846. Having explained
these tables, he then, in no very measured
terms, charged Mr. Porter with “cushioning,” or
covering up for an unfair comparison, the merchant
navies of surrounding nations, and especially that
of the United States. He accused that gentleman
distinctly of giving unfairly all the ships engaged
in the foreign, coasting, and colonial trade of England,
in his return of British tonnage; while the
ships of the United States, engaged in the foreign
trade <i>only</i>, were given in that of the American
tonnage. By these means, an attempt was made
to prove that a large mass of tonnage of foreign
nations was “cushioned” up, or kept out of sight
of the English people, because it would alarm
them, if they were to see such an immense tonnage
of foreign vessels rising around them, “as
the day would come when they would knock at
our doors.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Offers
valuable
details of
ship-building.</div>

<p>Elaborate tables of the prices of articles used in
ship-building, furnished by Mr. Richmond, on the
authority of the most competent persons engaged in
the respective branches of this trade, will be found
in his evidence; and, here it may be desirable, as a
record of facts, to give an extract from a communication
from the principal agent of Lloyd’s, which
Mr. Richmond read to the Committee, in reply to a
query with reference to the cost of new first-class
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>ships, as it appears that sales were effected at the
prices therein named.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The price per ton declined 1<i>l.</i> per ton, according to
the years for which the vessel was classed; and according
to the North Country Club Rules, 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per ton
may be added to these prices for a Baltic outfit—that
is, for a ship when ready for a Baltic voyage.
As a corollary to these prices, which were, indeed,
much lower than the London rates (bad as well
as good ships being built in Sunderland), a list
was given of the shipbuilders who had failed in
Sunderland within the short period from 1841 down
to 1847. The list comprised no less than 40 names—a
melancholy catalogue—many of them were men
whose fathers and grandfathers had moved in good

<p>On the question of <i>Reciprocity</i>, about which there
was, subsequently, so much discussion, Mr. Richmond
declared, that there could be no prosperity in England
till the Reciprocity Treaties, as well as all the
Orders in Council enforcing them, were totally
repealed. He looked with extreme jealousy at the
beautiful and well-appointed ships frequenting Newcastle
from Russian and Swedish Finland: but, he
saw that no fairer class of merchant ships came to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>any port; their dimensions, their rigging, everything
about them was admirable; while their commanders
and officers inspired respect from their
general competency. Their log-books were beautifully
kept in English: and, from the education the
younger population, who were destined for the sea,
received, no better disciplined nor more orderly or
sedate crews could be seen than on board these
ships.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
jealousy of
the
Northern
Powers.</div>

<p>No doubt, these northern maritime countries
could be regarded in no other light than that of
formidable rivals. Therefore Mr. Richmond and his
fellow-shipowners saw with alarm any efforts made to
throw open the trade of the Empire, as the increasing
success of these foreign rivals must obviously dispossess
English shipowners of an immense portion
of the carrying trade. Mr. Richmond, therefore,
demanded, that not only the Reciprocity Treaties
should be annulled, but that the law of Charles II.
should be adopted, which enacted that “no goods or
commodities whatsoever of the growth, production,
or manufacture of Africa, Asia, or America, or of
any part thereof, or which are described, or laid
down, in the usual maps or cards of those places, be
imported into England, Ireland, or Wales, the islands
of Guernsey, Jersey, or the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed,
<i>in any other ship or ships</i>, but in such as do
truly, and without fraud, belong only to the people
of England,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Such were the extreme views promulgated by
many of the advocates of Protection. Indeed, the
majority of the shipowners, especially of the eastern
ports, would not have hesitated to retaliate on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
vessels of the northern nations with hostile tonnage
duties. Nor was their feeling less hostile against
France, though the trade with that country was insignificant
except for the conveyance of coals; as, in
all the French contracts, it was stipulated that coal
should be transported thither in either French or
English vessels. The extreme Protectionists asserted
that the Spaniards and Italians were monopolising a
large portion of the trade from Liverpool; and that
American merchants, in sending an order for goods
to be executed in England, “gave special orders
that they should be shipped on board an American
liner.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
of Mr.
Braysher,
Collector
of
Customs
in London.</div>

<p>As, however, the object of this work is rather to
show the practical working of the old Navigation
Laws than to dwell on the political opinions propounded
in this controversy, it is desirable to
allude to the evidence given by Mr. Braysher, at
that time the Collector of Customs in London,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
who stated that in the discharge of his duties it
was requisite to see that the Navigation Act was
duly enforced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
effect of
the Navigation
Laws on
the
Customs.</div>

<div class="sidenote">With the
Northern
ports,</div>

<p>Some curious results were developed in the course
of his evidence with regard to the working of these
laws. Thus the second clause of the Act relating to
the trade between Europe and England gave certain
privileges in the carrying of twenty-nine “enumerated”
articles, all of which, with two exceptions,
were raw materials, and, therefore, only importable
from Europe in British ships. The intention of the
law had been, originally, to permit the importation
of raw materials only; and, till recently, all manufactured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
goods were either positively or virtually
prohibited by the imposition of the high duties. It
appeared, however, that butter and cheese, and also
the spirit named geneva, could be imported in
foreign ships, but no advantage was taken of this
privilege. The timber trade differed, as that article
could be imported in a ship of the country where it
grew, or in a ship of the country from which it
was usually brought, but this privilege, with these
exceptions, was given entirely to British vessels.
Nevertheless, British ships did not generally bring
timber from the Baltic ports to England; while in
the unprotected trade of butter and cheese, which
was considerable, British shipowners, by means of
steamers, monopolised the chief part of it.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The inference
from these circumstances was drawn that
Protection had very little to do in controlling the
course of this trade. Russia was, however, an exception,
as the vast proportion of that trade was carried
on by British ships; and this, necessarily, arose from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>the provisions of the second clause of the Navigation
Act, because tallow, hemp, flax and pitch, the chief
produce of Russia, could only be brought in British
or Russian ships; and, as there was not a sufficient
Russian mercantile marine to maintain the trade, a
virtual monopoly of it fell to British ships, partly
through the Navigation Law and partly through the
relative circumstances of the merchant marine of
the two countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and
America.</div>

<p>Much stress was laid on the fact that goods, the
produce of “America,” could not be brought from
Europe; thus, by this clause, American cotton once
landed at Havre<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> could not be brought over for the
consumption of the manufacturers, whatever demand
might exist for the article. It was, however, proved
that this clause was framed long prior to the American
independence, and, hence, had no special
reference to cotton, nor, indeed, any political tendency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty
about
“manufactured”
articles.</div>

<p>It appeared, however, unquestionable, taking the
two Navigation Laws together, the American Law
and that of England, so far as the trade between the
United States and Great Britain was concerned, that
we had decidedly the worst of it. Again: the fifth
clause of the Navigation Act was the cause of much
question at the Customs, and occasioned great inconvenience;
this clause ran thus: that all “manufactured”
goods shall be deemed to be the produce of the
country of which they are the “manufacture.” Thus,
coffee imported at Hamburg from its place of growth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>in Asia or America was roasted and ground there;
but, when merchants attempted to bring it into England
as a manufactured article, the claim was refused
by the law officers of the Crown. Again, mahogany,
cut into veneers, was at first not allowed to be a
manufactured article; but this decision was afterwards
reversed, and veneers were deemed manufactures.
In like manner, ostrich feathers, brought from
Africa and manufactured in France, offered a very
doubtful case, and was, in fact, left undecided, though
the impression was, on the whole, adverse to their
admission. Refined sugar was deemed a manufacture;
and, thus, while <i>raw</i> sugar, the growth of
Brazil or Cuba, could not come in from Holland,
it could, when refined, be imported. A recent Act
required that refined sugar should not only be the
produce, but the growth of the country from which
it was imported, thereby causing a new difficulty, and
showing that the law discouraged the refining of
sugar in Holland, and discouraged it at the place
of growth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anomalies
of coasting
and internal
trade.</div>

<p>Again: it was shown that, from the earliest period,
foreign ships which could not carry goods from London
to Plymouth, could, nevertheless, carry passengers,
as such a trade was not considered by the
Customs authorities to be trading <i>coastwise</i>. Nay, it
further appeared that foreign vessels could have engaged
in the internal trade of the country, there
being no legal impediment to prevent a Dutch vessel
from plying, either with goods or passengers, between
London and Gravesend. The like principle might
have prevailed on any of the rivers of the kingdom;
but a foreign vessel would not have been allowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
carry goods from one <i>port</i> to another. The interdiction
against foreign vessels carrying “passengers”
was only inserted for the first time in the 8 &amp; 9 Vict.,
cap. 88 (1845), and, previously to this period, there
was no law to prevent a foreign steamer carrying
passengers between two English ports; while, even
in 1847, a vessel built in Norway could have plied in
the Thames. Foreigners, however, either were ignorant
of the law, or did not avail themselves of it,
considering it a barren advantage.</p>

<p>With Mr. Braysher’s evidence may be brought to
a close the extracts necessary to be given from the
mass of conflicting statements and documents laid
before Mr. Ricardo’s Committee, and I may now
proceed with the general history of the measures
pursued and subsequently adopted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Committee’s
last
meeting,
July 17.</div>

<div class="sidenote">General
dissatisfaction
with the
results of
the inquiry.</div>

<p>On the 17th of July, the Committee of the House
of Commons held its last sitting; and as a dissolution
of Parliament was impending, the Committee, after
having published four successive reports, strictly confined
to the minutes of the evidence taken before
them, came to the conclusion of closing the inquiry.
The Protectionist shipowners complained that this
abrupt termination of the inquiry was brought about
with the view of suppressing the evidence of Mr. D.
C. Aylwin, an intelligent merchant connected with
the Calcutta trade, who was in attendance to give
counter-testimony to many of the Free-trade witnesses.
It was also patent that, during the investigation,
while twenty-five witnesses had been examined in
favour of the repeal of the Navigation Laws, on
the other hand, for their defence and maintenance,
only nine persons had been called to give their testimony.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
It was therefore urged that the proceedings
of the Committee and the abrupt termination of the
inquiry were anything but fair, the more so that
no practical results had been obtained, though the
evidence procured was, ultimately, of considerable
importance.</p>

<p>Thus ended this important inquiry in a manner
scarcely satisfactory to either party; nor was the investigation
again revived in the committee-rooms of
the House of Commons, the scene of the contest
being transferred elsewhere. On the 23rd July,
1847, Parliament was dissolved; and at the subsequent
general election the Free-trade party was triumphant
everywhere, Mr. Cardwell gaining his election
at Liverpool, while Mr. Cobden was returned in
his absence for the West Riding of Yorkshire, as well
as for Stockport; Mr. C. P. Villiers, on whose motion
the Corn Laws had been repealed, being also doubly
returned for South Lancashire and Wolverhampton,
both these elections affording thereby unmistakable
evidences of the feeling of the country in favour of
unfettered commerce. With so great an accession
of strength to the Whig Government, further progress
in Free-trade measures became inevitable, and the
greatest uneasiness prevailed among shipowners as
to their future destiny.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commercial
panic</div>

<p>Though events of a calamitous character to general
commerce intervened, the shipping interest escaped,
and, indeed, flourished. Beyond the large quantities
of corn necessary to import, so as to meet the urgent
wants of the famishing people of Ireland, it was found
by the end of December, 1846, that the deficiency of
grain in France, Belgium, and Germany, as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
in the south of Europe, was greater than had been
apprehended, and, consequently, prices rose throughout
the Continent, the average reaching 75<i>s.</i> per
quarter in England.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Suddenly, large quantities of
shipping were again required to execute orders
received from France and Belgium for purchases
made at advanced prices. The alarm lest the scarcity
should still further increase became general; and, in
consequence of this, together with apprehensions
for the home crops, the average price of wheat
rose in May (29th), 1847, to 102<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i><a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Such prices
naturally led to great speculation; while the efforts
made to bring corn from the most distant regions
gave an enormous impulse to the carrying trade, both
in Europe and elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">and distress
of
1847.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Suspension
of
Bank
Charter
Act.</div>

<p>But a frightful reaction soon followed. Corn was
poured into the ports of Great Britain from all parts
of the world with astonishing rapidity. The docks
of Liverpool exhibited a quantity of flour that, perhaps,
had never been, at any previous period or in
any country, imported by merchant vessels to one
market. Prices fell to 56<i>s.</i> per quarter for wheat,
and heavy commercial disasters ensued. Money advanced
in value; in August and December the pressure for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
it increased to a panic. The Bank rate of
interest rose to 10 per cent.; and the discount of the
best paper became almost impossible. Numerous
failures followed; and as representations were made
that the credit of the country itself was seriously
threatened, Government, on the 25th October, reluctantly
stepped forward to arrest further disasters, and
took upon themselves the responsibility of risking
the violation of the provisions of the Bank Charter
Act of 1844; Lord Russell, as First Lord of the
Treasury, and Sir Charles Wood, then Chancellor of
the Exchequer, advising the Bank to enlarge the
amount of its discounts and advances to a minimum
of 8 per cent., promising if any infringement of the
law should result that Government would secure a
Bill of indemnity for the Bank on the meeting of
Parliament.</p>

<p>The measures taken by Government produced a
salutary effect on commercial circles; and as no actual
infringement of the Bank Act of 1844 had occurred,
Ministers, considering the purpose they had in view
by their letter of October 25th fully answered, intimated
that it was unnecessary any longer to continue
in force this letter of relief and indemnity.</p>

per ton from the West Indies or Cuba, equal to one-third of a penny
per lb., while the duty was 14<i>s.</i> per cwt., or 1½<i>d.</i> per lb., any reduction
in the freight could not reach the consumer. Such was, also,
the case with other articles of large consumption. The average freight
of tea was 4<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> per ton, of 50 cubic feet, equal to 1-5/10<i>d.</i> per lb., the duty
2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> per lb. The average freight on tobacco from New Orleans had
been 50<i>s.</i> per hogshead, or equal to 7/15ths of a penny per lb.; from
Virginia, 35<i>s.</i> per hogshead, or one-third of a penny per lb.; the duty
being 3<i>s.</i> per lb. Taking flour from the United States at 4<i>s.</i> per barrel,
freight would be a farthing a lb. The freight upon indigo at 4<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> per
ton, of 50 cubic feet, would be equal to 11/16 a lb. The freight on coffee
at 4<i>l.</i> per ton is equal to about one-third of a penny per lb., the duty
on foreign being 6<i>d.</i>, and on coffee from the British possessions 4<i>d.</i>
per lb. On cotton the average freight for the previous ten years from
Bombay, 3<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per ton, of 50 cubic feet, which is equivalent to 7/16ths
of a penny per lb.; from the United States it was estimated at 5/8ths of a
penny per lb. At these rates, it was urged that it would require a
microscopic coinage to secure it to the consumer; it would all be absorbed.
Supposing the freight to be reduced one-third, below which
no British shipowner could live, leaving a fair freight to pay for the
expenses of the ship, and a small profit, and supposing the freight to
be so reduced from the foreigner sailing cheaper than we could, it was
contended that no benefit could result to the consumer: on the other
hand, by its retention, you retain, also, that which it is of the most
vital interest for any country to retain, its national defences.</p>

twelve months’ duration of a British ship of 500 tons, and of a ship
of equal tonnage of the above-mentioned nations respectively, and taking
the items of wages, insurance, interest on capital, calculated at 5 per
cent., and depreciation of the property, which experience warrants at
10 per cent. per annum, the total amount of those items, on a ship of
500 tons built in England, and costing 8750<i>l.</i>, would be 2623<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> on
such a voyage; on a ship of the United States, costing, as estimated,
7250<i>l.</i>, it would be 2191<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>; that on a Dutch ship, costing 7000<i>l.</i>, it
would be 2110<i>l.</i>; that on a Bremen ship, costing 5500<i>l.</i>, it would be
1626<i>l.</i>; that on a Swedish ship, costing the same amount, it would be
1550<i>l.</i>; and that on a Prussian ship, costing 4720<i>l.</i>, it would be 1329<i>l.</i>;
making a difference in favour of an American ship of 432<i>l.</i>; of a Dutch
ship of 513<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>; of a Bremen ship of 997<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>; of a Swedish ship of
1073<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>; and of a Prussian ship of 1294<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> These gross disbursements
resolved into their elements, as regards wages, stood thus. The
wages on a British ship were calculated at 786<i>l.</i>; the wages of an
American ship of the same size, viz., 500 tons, 669<i>l.</i>; in a Dutch
ship, 640<i>l.</i>; in a Bremen ship, 471<i>l.</i>; in a Swedish ship, 395<i>l.</i>; and in
a Prussian ship, 331<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> The items of these wages, as regards British
ships, were, an English captain, 10<i>l.</i> a month [that is the amount of
wages, but the emoluments of a British captain would be very much
more than that]; chief mate, 6<i>l.</i> per month; second mate, 4<i>l.</i> per

2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>; nine able seamen, at 45<i>s.</i> each, 20<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>; eight ordinary seamen,
at 30<i>s.</i> each, 12<i>l.</i>; and three apprentices, at 15<i>s.</i> each, 2<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>; making

<div class="sidenote">New Parliament,
November
18, 1847.</div>

<p>On the 18th of November, 1847, the new Parliament
was opened by commission. It had been thus early
called together to consider the distress caused by the
recent commercial embarrassments and the severe
pressure still prevailing in Ireland, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
an abundant harvest, together with the importation
of an unprecedented quantity of grain, flour, and
provisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Speech
from
Throne.</div>

<p>The Speaker having been chosen, the Speech from
the Throne, delivered by the Marquess of Lansdowne,
contained the following important paragraph:—“Her
Majesty recommends to the consideration of Parliament
the laws which regulate the navigation of the
United Kingdom, with a view to ascertain whether
any changes can be adopted which, without danger
to our maritime strength, may promote the commercial
and colonial interests of the empire.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Robinson
and
Shipowners
deceived.</div>

<p>The guarded terms in which this paragraph was
couched lulled the suspicions of some of the leaders
of the Protectionist party. Mr. Robinson, a merchant
connected with the Newfoundland trade, and an
influential member of Lloyd’s, was, at that time, in
Parliament for the borough of Poole. On the debate
on the Address, he said, “<i>that with respect to the
Navigation Laws, he had looked with much attention to
the precise words in her Majesty’s Speech on this subject,
and he did not object to them</i>. He did not object to
inquiry into those laws, with a view to consider any
or what relaxation or modification might be made
applicable to the existing state of things, and the
maintenance of the maritime interests of Great
Britain and her dependencies.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conversation
between
Mr. Bancroft
and
Lord Palmerston.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Bancroft’s
declaration.</div>

<p>But though Mr. Robinson and the party of whose
views he was then the exponent may have deluded
themselves into a belief that Government had no
intention of bringing any measure into Parliament
for the abrogation of the Navigation Laws, it is, now,
beyond doubt that the administration of Lord Russell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
whatever might have been his Lordship’s individual
opinions, had resolved to introduce and support,
with all its power, a very sweeping measure. In the
autumn of 1847 the American Minister put himself
in communication and had interviews with Lord
Palmerston, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
at which Mr. Labouchere was present.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> On one of
these occasions, Mr. Bancroft informed them that the
American Government, believing it was the disposition
of Parliament to make a large and liberal
alteration in the Navigation Laws, was anxious to
co-operate with the English Ministers in that great
work, and, in conjunction with them, to set an
example which he hoped would be productive of
important and salutary effects. Mr. Bancroft’s language
was singularly expressive and emphatic. In
one of the interviews he said to the English
Ministers: “We are ready to do anything you like;
if you can do but little, we must do little; if you can
do much, we will do much; <span class="allsmcap">IF YOU SHALL DO ALL,
WE SHALL DO ALL</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>This important declaration (whether or not Mr.
Bancroft had any authority for making it in all its
fulness) became at a future period the subject of
incessant comment and controversy. It is important,
therefore, that the facts, as they occurred, should be
clearly stated. There can be no doubt that this conversation
took place in the month of October 1847, but
what Mr. Bancroft meant must probably ever remain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>a matter of conjecture. If, however, language is of
any value in conveying the views or intention of the
person who speaks, it may fairly be presumed that the
<i>positive</i> expression “little” had reference to the carriage
of European produce, indifferently, in either
American or British ships to the ports of the United
States, and the general produce of the world from
American ports in the like manner to ports of Great
Britain. The equivalent the Americans could give in
return for the <i>comparative</i> “much,” presuming this
to mean unrestricted trade with British colonies, is
difficult to conjecture; seeing that the Americans
have no colonies, and, in point of fact, no equivalent
whatever to give. As regards the <i>superlative</i> “<i>all</i>,
in return for <i>all</i>,” it could only have had reference
to the coasting trade so jealously guarded at that
time by <i>both</i> countries; and, in the sequel, it will
be evident how far this magnanimous offer corresponded
with the tenacious policy then and to this
day adhered to by the United States Government.</p>

<p>Lord Palmerston, entertaining a strong feeling in
favour of the repeal of the Navigation Laws, at once
perceived what use could be made of the concurrence
of the United States Government in a <span class="allsmcap">LARGE</span> measure
of reform. He accordingly requested Mr. Bancroft to
put his views in a formal communication, which was
done as follows:—</p>

</p>

<p>“The undersigned, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary
of the United States of America, has the honour to
inquire of Viscount Palmerston, her British Majesty’s Principal
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, if her Majesty’s Government
is inclined to remove existing restrictions on international
commerce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Universal reciprocity, in the widest sense</i>, is held by the American
Government as the only thoroughly appropriate basis for
intercourse between two great nations. The prohibition of the
indirect trade has but restrained enterprise: it has done good to
neither country. To abrogate it would at once set free dormant
commercial wealth without injuring any one.</p>

<p>“Should her Majesty’s Government entertain similar views,
the undersigned is prepared on the part of the American
Government to propose that British ships may trade from any
port of the world to any port in the United States, and be
received, protected, and, in respect to charges and duties, be
treated like American ships, if, reciprocally, American ships
may in like manner trade from any port in the world to any
port under the dominion of her British Majesty.</p>

<p>“The removal of commercial restrictions, while it would be
of mutual advantage to the material interests of both countries,
could not but give openings to still further relations of amity
between them, and, by its influence on the intercourse of
nations, create new guarantees for the peace of the world.</p>

<p>It thus appears that the English Ministers communicated
their intentions formally and explicitly to
the American Government, and, through that Government
to the American people, a day before they
chose to inform the English Parliament and the
nation, somewhat vaguely, in the Queen’s Speech,
of the course they might, eventually, be led to pursue.
A year previously, on the 21st of December, 1846,
the Shipowners’ Society of London had had an interview
with Lord Clarendon at the Board of Trade.
On that occasion, as appears from the Minutes of
the Society, they were graciously received, and
assured in distinct language, that no intention was
entertained on the part of her Majesty’s Government
of making any alteration in these laws. Three
months later, on the 15th March, 1847, these gentlemen,
entertaining a feeling of mistrust in the then
governing powers, went again to the Board of Trade
and asked the same question, and were once more
assured that there was no intention on the part
of Government to interfere with the fundamental
principles of the Navigation Laws; that an individual
member, Mr. Ricardo, had indeed mooted
the subject of a committee, which Government could
not refuse, but that the committee should be a fair
one, with Mr. Milner Gibson<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> as chairman, as they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>were desirous to give satisfaction to all parties
interested. So far no intention was expressed of
tampering with these laws; and we have seen that
Mr. Robinson, on scrutinising the terms of the Queen’s
Speech in November, acquiesced in its propriety, no
suspicion having entered his mind, that, already,
these laws were foredoomed by Ministers, still less
that, the very day before Parliament met, they had
communicated their intentions to a foreign maritime
Power—a nation, too, which, at that moment, was
straining every nerve to wrest from us the supremacy
of the ocean. Under such circumstances as
these, the following article, first published in the
‘Washington Union,’<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> created intense astonishment.
Nor is it surprising that it should have done so:—</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interview
between
Lord
Palmerston
and
Mr. Bancroft
published
in
‘Washington
Union.’</div>

<p>“<i>Repeal of the Navigation Laws.</i>—A correspondence
has taken place between the British Secretary
for Foreign Affairs and our Minister at that Court
relative to the repeal of the Navigation Laws of
Great Britain. Mr. Bancroft applied to Viscount
Palmerston early in November to learn whether
Ministers would consent to establish with the United
States a perfect system of reciprocity, in making all
vessels of either country, fitting out from any port
of the world, free to trade to any port of the other
nation, whether home or colonial. Viscount Palmerston,
after the lapse of some weeks (<i>it was just fourteen
days</i>), replied that, although her Majesty’s
Ministers did not feel at liberty to advise her Majesty
at once to make such a change in the commercial
system as was asked by Mr. Bancroft without the
consent of Parliament, yet as soon as that body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
should meet, a measure would be introduced which
would embrace all the views put forth by Mr. Bancroft
in his note. It is not doubted that Parliament
will at once act favourably on the Bill. The importance
to the United States of such a measure
can scarcely be exaggerated. The British colonial
system has been a most grievous restriction on our
commerce, and its annihilation, as promised by Lord
Palmerston, will open to our enterprising merchants
the lucrative trade of the East and West Indies, and
of the other British settlements from which they
have been hitherto debarred. This will be the
greatest stride yet taken by Free-trade: and it is
<i>not to be doubted that all Europe will follow the example
of Great Britain</i>! The liberal commercial treaty
made by Hanover with the United States has been
in no small degree instrumental in disposing the
British Government to this wise measure. The
Rhine provinces have recently imitated the example
of Hanover towards the United States; and everywhere
silently but steadily our commercial relations
are being put upon the most advantageous footing.
The repeal by Great Britain of the laws restricting
the trade of the United States with her colonies will
be far more beneficial to this country than any commercial
treaty ever made by our Government.”</p>

<p>Such was the announcement put forth in the
American journals semi-officially, and the reader will
judge how far this “puff direct” of the American
executive was borne out by facts, or the dates and
tenor of the correspondence given between the American
Minister in England and the English Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs. The spirit of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
perfect liberality, and, I must add, <i>complete reciprocity</i>,
seemed to pervade all Mr. Bancroft’s professions
when communicating with Lord Palmerston
and Mr. Labouchere, promising “little, much, and
all,” according as the same could be obtained from
Parliament. In his special despatch, he described
the concessions his Government was prepared to
grant, as universal reciprocity in its widest sense,
which, if it meant anything at all, meant the opening
to our ships of their extensive coasting trade in
return for the opening of our still more extensive
colonial trade to the ships of the United States; or,
if such was not his meaning, it meant that, <i>when</i>
we opened our coasting trade, they would do so likewise.
But the latter portion of his despatch, and
the semi-official announcement in the ‘Washington
Union,’ contain, in other respects, many vague
generalities and, as subsequently appeared, the
Government of the United States never had any
intention of opening its coasting trade to the ships
of Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Excites
great indignation

<p>When the correspondence transpired in January
1848, it created great astonishment, if not alarm
and indignation, throughout the country, especially
among shipowners and all persons who considered
that their best interests were interwoven with the
maintenance of the Navigation Laws. The Conservative
press loudly reproached Lord Palmerston
for having made known the intentions of Government
with regard to this important measure to the
American Minister before communicating them to
Parliament; nor could the Liberals approve of the
course that had been adopted.</p>

re-assembles
on February
3,
1848.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Palmerston
admits the
correspondence
with.
America.</div>

<p>On the evening of the 3rd February, 1848, the
day of the re-assembling of Parliament, there was
considerable excitement in the House of Commons,
and, amidst it, Mr. Robinson asked the Foreign
Minister whether any correspondence or communication
had taken place between him and the Minister
of the United States about the Navigation Laws;
and, if so, whether he would lay it upon the table?
Lord Palmerston, with the ready tact for which he
was distinguished, and with the smiling coolness so
characteristic of him, especially in times of excitement,
at once and frankly avowed that there had
been such a correspondence; looking, with a twinkle
in his eye and a smile on his lip, at Mr. Robinson,
as if to inquire in turn, and “if there has been,
what is there to make such a fuss about?” adding
that the correspondence would, at once, be laid on
the table.</p>

<p>This announcement, perhaps more from the manner
in which it was made than from the fact accompanying
it, that Ministers intended immediately to submit
to Parliament a proposition on the subject, quieted
the House, but, at the same time, awakened the
shipowners out of doors to what they considered
their dangerous situation. They felt conscious that,
in the House of Commons, a Free-trade majority
would sanction any measure the Government might
have the courage to propose. On the other hand, in
the House of Lords, where popular passions prevailed
less, they hoped to find a less prejudiced tribunal;
hence, they prudently resolved to change the “venue,”
and to appeal to the Upper House for the perpetuation
of Protection. With this view they selected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Lord Hardwicke as their mouthpiece and champion;
and, in order to complete the inquiry commenced by
the Lower House in the preceding session, resolved
to move the appointment of a Committee of the
Lords to inquire into the policy and operation of the
Navigation Laws; the shipowners being sanguine
that there, at least, they would be able to make out
a satisfactory case, and counteract the one-sided
evidence they conceived had been given by the
repeal party before the Committee of the Commons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Earl
of Hardwicke’s
proposal,
February
25, 1848.</div>

<p>Accordingly Lord Hardwicke on the 25th February,
pursuant to notice, moved the appointment of
a Select Committee of the Lords.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Recapitulating
in his speech the events of the preceding year, and,
dwelling in terms of indignation on the dissimulation
which, he said, had been practised, he charged
Ministers with having deceived the country; and
stigmatised the whole evidence before the Committee
of the Commons as one-sided and unfair. He complained
that a distinguished officer of the Royal Navy,
Sir James Stirling, had given his evidence in favour
of the abolition of the Navigation Laws; but that,
before he could be cross-examined, the Committee
were informed, that the duty of the gallant officer
required his absence, and that he had sailed from
England. His Lordship then entered into numerous
details, pronouncing Mr. Porter’s evidence to be false;
he, and the statistical officers of the Board of Trade,
“being learned in that description of theory which was
so popular now-a-days;” whereby forty-seven vessels
of 7101 tons, which had, in 1846, entered inwards
from French ports, were converted, by multiplying the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>number of entries inwards, into 228,186 tons, and by
treating the clearances outwards in a similar manner
magnified to such an extent that they represented
556,824 tons; while the <i>Prince Ernest</i>, a passenger
and mail boat, employed between Calais and Dover,
of 145 tons, figured in the Custom House returns
as 24,215 tons of British shipping!<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Earl Grey
grants a
Committee.</div>

<p>Earl Grey, in granting the committee, took care
to express an opinion, that no further inquiry was
necessary. He defended the course taken by his
colleague, Lord Palmerston, contending that no
understanding had been come to with the Government
of the United States with regard to the repeal
of the Navigation Laws, and that the correspondence
implied nothing more, than that a mutual relaxation
of existing restrictions would be beneficial to the
maritime commerce of both countries: he concluded
by defending Mr. Porter’s returns, and added, that
“their Lordships would find that, on strict examination,
the allegations of falseness would vanish
altogether.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
of the
Shipowners
before
the
Lords’
Committee.</div>

<p>The contest being thus transferred for the time to
a Committee of the Lords, the shipowners feeling
sure of success before this tribunal, brought forward
a large amount of evidence, much of which was
instructive, though somewhat conflicting. Mr. G. F.
Young, who again took the leading part, insisted
that if foreign ships were allowed to trade indiscriminately
with British possessions, and took part
in the indirect trade with foreign countries, it would
be impossible that British ships could obtain an
equivalent, because by far the greater proportion of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>foreign States do not possess any colonies. But, even
if they had anything to offer in return, he had little
faith in “reciprocity;” because every nation, <i>except
England</i>, appears to exhibit, with respect to its
maritime commerce, an intense feeling of nationality,
and a fixed determination to support its commercial
marine. Sweden, he said, admits any article used
in the construction and equipment of Swedish-built
ships duty free, and remits to such vessels, for the
first year after they are built, the export duties on
goods charged to others. Russia adopted a somewhat
similar policy by exempting all vessels built in
that country from the payment of her port-charges,
for the first three years after they were launched.
But Mr. Young failed to see that, while all such
concessions as these must be made good by extra
taxes on the people of the respective countries, they
were at the same time prejudicial to their own
shipping, in that they encouraged the production of
cheap and inferior vessels.</p>

<p>Numerous arguments of a similar character were
adduced, some based on facts, others on conjectures;
and not a few adverted to heavy losses the British
shipowner contemplated from causes which never had
and never could have any real existence. Prussia,
for instance, he said, confines the trade in the
importation of salt to her own ships, which was
true; America, invariably, gave the preference to
her own ships, a statement either conjectural or,
in some degree, supported by the fact that her merchants
often found it to their interest as traders, and,
not through any feeling of “intense nationality,” to
employ on certain trades their own ships in preference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
to those of any other nation. He further
alleged that British shipowners would be irretrievably
ruined by the admission of foreign ships,
an assertion, of course, speculative, or purely imaginary.
While maintaining that the evils of the
Navigation Laws had been greatly overrated, he
thought the advantages of these restrictive laws were
equally exaggerated. He, however, attached the
very greatest importance to the “Long Voyage
clause,” considering that it was far from clear that the
interests of the country required its repeal, or that it
could be safely repealed without the most injurious
consequences to British navigation; in a word, he
thought no other clause in the Navigation Act so
essential to the maintenance of British navigation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Young
proposes
some modifications,</div>

<p>He could not, however, fail to see that the impossibility
of bringing American cotton from Havre,
cochineal from Teneriffe, or hides from Buenos Ayres
(about which great complaints had been raised), occasioned
great inconvenience. The cochineal from Teneriffe
was no doubt, as explained elsewhere, absurdly
exaggerated as a grievance, but it involved other
articles, and could not be maintained on principle.
Mr. Young, therefore, to remedy this evil, suggested
a modification of the third clause of the Navigation
Act, by introducing some words with respect to the
produce of distant quarters of the world, as that
which regulated by the second clause the importations
from Europe; namely, by the limitation of the
restriction to certain articles to be specifically enumerated;
the enumerated articles being made to comprise
all those bulky commodities, the retention of
the importation of which to British shipping was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
of the last importance, while the surrender of the
remainder would not materially affect British maritime
commerce, and ought therefore, in his opinion,
to be conceded to general convenience. The effect of
this would be to exclude from the restriction such
minor articles as are not the staple produce of those
countries, and which, though not entering largely
into British consumption, might occasionally be required
as part of assorted cargoes. Another relaxation
Mr. Young proposed, guarding himself, however,
by stating that he had no authority to do so from
any constituted body of shipowners, was to introduce
in like manner, in perfect accordance with the
general principle of the Navigation Laws, a permission
to import the produce of Asia, Africa, and
America, not only from the country of production,
but, from the country within those distant parts of
the world in which the produce might be found.
Under such a regulation, he explained that if it
should happen that the hides of Buenos Ayres were
found at New York, it would enable those hides to
be imported into England either in British ships or
in American ships; and it would enable tea, the produce
of China, in like manner to be imported from
New York, or any part of Asia, Africa, or America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">the first
concessions
of
the Anti-Repeal
party.</div>

<p>This was, perhaps, the first concession which the
anti-repeal party had made with regard to the Navigation
Laws. They vainly thought it would tend to
settle the whole question. They saw that the relaxation
proposed, if fully carried out, while meeting
many of the cases of real grievance complained of by
commission merchants, would practically retain most
important advantages they would never consent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
relinquish, but which they would as certainly lose if
they were to allow the importation of goods, the
produce of distant quarters of the globe, in foreign
ships direct into Great Britain from the place of
production.</p>

<p>This modification of the Navigation Laws was,
doubtless, important, and was said to be in strict
harmony with the principle then regulating the importation
of goods from the various countries of
Europe, which, in 1825, was permitted by Mr. Huskisson
to be made from the place where found, the
earlier restriction having been that the importation
must be from the place of production.</p>

<p>The shipowners would still have retained to British
shipping the advantage of the direct voyage, which
was, after all, their great point. In consenting to
the plan, they urged that, in the end, the interest of
the consumer would be equally secured with that of
the shipowner, by giving that encouragement afforded
by the Navigation Act to direct rather than indirect
importation. The opponents of repeal exhibited
great alarm lest, if indirect importations were permitted,
these would take place from distant ports of
the world into the nearer ports of Europe, and be
there warehoused: and they expressed the fear that
the people of this country would then consume considerable
proportions of the productions of tropical
climates, burdened with the expenses of previous
importation into the ports of continental nations, in
addition to what was then paid under the limited
direct importation!! It was only, he said, with the
view of remedying palpable absurdities, such as that
of the hides brought from Buenos Ayres to Hamburg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
that Mr. Young suggested a modification of
the existing law, which he thought would not merely
meet that case, but also remove the greater part of
the inconveniences complained of arising from the
operation of the Navigation Laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Government
insists
on
Total Repeal.</div>

<p>But these concessions were not sufficient for the requirements
of Government. They, or rather the Free-trade
party, which had by this time greatly increased
in power and influence, had long felt that the principle
on which the Navigation Laws were framed
was entirely wrong, and consequently, that they could
not accept any modification short of total and unconditional
repeal. But they knew, also, they had still a
powerful party to contend against, and that it was
necessary to fortify their opinions by as strong an
array of facts as could be collected. These were not,
however, easily obtainable; nor could the advantages
derivable from free navigation be proved by experience.
No nation as yet had put this to the test;
and, in fact, experience would hitherto have shown
that the experiment of throwing open British ports
to vessels of all nations, so that they might enter and
depart, unconditionally, would have been alike unwise
and dangerous. Nevertheless, Government felt its
views to be sound, and that the change contemplated
would benefit shipowners as well as the nation, but,
in the absence of facts, experience alone could support
the opinions thus formed and used as arguments in
favour of the Government policy. The inferiority, in
many respects, of the masters of our merchant ships,
compared with those of other nations, which competition,
they said, would improve, as well as the vessels
under their charge, was one of their strongest points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>But Government had to meet many other arguments
on which no experience existed; and, not the
least of these was the question of manning the navy,
embracing the all-important one of the maintenance
of the British fleet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Detailed
views of
Admiral
Sir George
Byam
Martin.</div>

<p>Among other witnesses who came before the Lords’
Committee, Admiral Sir George Byam Martin was a
stout advocate for upholding the Navigation Laws.
He contended that these laws gave encouragement
to the British shipowner by exclusive advantages
in the colonial and coasting trade, which he regarded
as a compensation for the obligation of building his
ships in some parts of the Queen’s dominions, and
of employing a certain number of apprentices. If
manufacturers really felt that these laws in any
degree cramped their commercial enterprise, they
ought also, he thought, to be content to yield somewhat
for the maintenance of a service to which they
all owed their protection and safety. The Admiral
held that the Navigation Laws gave protection to
British seamen, by securing to them employment in
a calling for which they qualified themselves by a
long and severe apprenticeship. There were only,
he said, four main objects presented to the shipowner
to give him hope of a satisfactory competition with
the cheap carriers of other countries:</p>

<p>1st. That by the abrogation of the Navigation
Laws he would be left at liberty to build his ships in
cheap foreign countries.</p>

<p>2ndly. That he would be allowed to take foreign
seamen, without limitation of number.</p>

<p>3rdly. That he would no longer be compelled to
take apprentices; and</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>4thly. As a further temptation to the shipowner
to be reconciled to the change, his men would no
longer be liable to impressment.</p>

<p>None, however, of these points could, in the opinion
of Admiral Martin, be conceded without loss to the
public service.</p>

<p>If the abrogation of the Navigation Laws left
the shipowner at liberty to build his ships in foreign
countries, and he availed himself of that licence, it
would inevitably diminish the shipwright class in this
kingdom; yet on this class, the admiral argued, the
safety of England had greatly depended during the
late and former wars, and this he thought would be
even more the case in any future wars in which the
country may be plunged.</p>

<p>“During the war which ended in 1815, we had,”
remarked the admiral, “800 pennants flying, and
even so many as 900 ships were in commission for a
considerable time. Great exertions were necessary
on the part of the shipwrights to keep up the repairs
of such a fleet, and to build new ships to supply the
decay and the casualties constantly going on. But
numerous as our fleet was then, it was likely to be on
a much larger scale hereafter; for, in addition to our
usual fleets, there must, of necessity, be an immense
number of steamers in a great measure as an addition,
though not as a substitute for sailing ships.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>The number of shipwrights in the King’s yards
throughout the war, he estimated, might be taken at
an average of 3714 and 875 apprentices, making a
total of 4589 working shipwrights, besides 550 in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>the colonial yards. Notwithstanding this great shipwright
strength, and the efforts exacted from them,
the Admiralty was obliged to seek every possible
assistance from the private shipbuilders,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and to these
persons Admiral Martin maintained protection was
due, considering how much they had done for the
country when we had enemies to deal with in every
quarter.</p>

<p>I need not dwell upon all the other points of
Admiral Martin’s evidence; but that which relates
to the merchant service and manning the navy must
not be omitted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of

up the

navy.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Arguments
from
his personal
experience
as to its
value as
a nursery
for
seamen.</div>

<p>If the Navigation Laws were done away, Admiral
Martin believed, the shipowner who would go to
foreign countries for cheap ships would, from the
same motive, take foreign seamen, such as Danes,
Swedes, Norwegians, or Dutchmen, who would be
content with small wages and a cheap scale of dietary.
In this way, a large number of British seamen would
be deprived of the employment they now enjoyed
owing mainly to the Navigation Laws; and, in such
a case, the naval service must suffer in proportion,
especially, when, in time of war, seamen are most
urgently required. It had been said, and it was a
“marvellous assertion,” that the merchant service
contributes so little towards the supply of the navy—that,
so far as concerned this point, there need be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>no hesitation in abandoning the Navigation Laws.
An assertion more completely contradicted by all
experience, Admiral Martin confidently stated, had
never been uttered. The merchant service, he held,
was everything to the navy, while the navy, he
was convinced, could not exist without it. He was
unable, adequately, to express his surprise at these
loose assertions, for every person who remembered
the muster of the navy immediately preceding the
war in 1793, could not fail to know that the glorious
victory of the 1st of June, 1794, under Lord Howe,
was gained by the merchant seamen of the kingdom.
We had not then, he said, 20,000 men, and these
were scattered over the globe when the war broke
out; it was, therefore, the merchant service that
enabled us rapidly to man some sixty sail of the
line, and double that number of frigates and smaller
vessels. By promptly bringing together about 35,000
or 40,000 seamen of the mercantile marine, Admiral
Gardner was able at once to proceed to the West
Indies with seven sail of the line, nine frigates
and sloops of war; Lord Hood to man twenty-two
sail of the line, and a large number of frigates and
sloops, with which he occupied Toulon and took
Corsica; while, by its aid, other squadrons were sent
to America and to the East Indies to protect our
interests in those quarters. The command of seamen
from the merchant service also enabled Lord
Howe to occupy the Channel with twenty-seven
sail of the line and numerous frigates, thereby affording
security to our own homes, and the means of
protecting our colonies and commerce by detached
squadrons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Working
of the
system of
apprenticeship,</div>

<p>Notwithstanding these proofs of naval energy on
the first outburst of the late war, and of the important
help derived from the merchant service, the number
of men obtained was, after all, inadequate to the wants
of the country. The merchant service, suddenly
drained of so many thousands, could, afterwards, give
only a comparatively small and occasional supply as
ships arrived from foreign ports, or as apprentices
grew out of their time. Now this continued, though
insufficient succour to the navy, Admiral Martin
thought, could never have been maintained throughout
so long a war but for the provident provisions of
the Navigation Laws in making it compulsory on
shipowners to take a certain number of apprentices,
and thus to keep up a constant replenishment of
seafaring men.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>He expressed himself of quite a different opinion
to those who were sanguine in believing the abrogation
of the Navigation Laws would increase our
shipping; and stoutly combated the notion that we
could retain the same quantity of tonnage after we
had entered on a system of rivalry with foreign
countries in cheap carrying. But, assuming that we
retained 4,000,000 tons<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> of shipping, it might be well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>to see how the comparison stood with respect to the
supply of men derived from the 1,500,000 in 1793,
and what might be expected from the present
4,000,000 tons. In 1793, and up to 1835, the Act
of Queen Anne secured a replenishment of seafaring
men by apprentices of more than double the number,
when we had only 1,500,000, to what the Act of
1835 did in 1848 with 4,000,000. Consequently, in
that respect, nothing was gained by the increased
tonnage. By the Act of Queen Anne, vessels of 30
tons were obliged to take an apprentice; whereas
under the Act of 1835 a vessel of 200 tons takes only
one apprentice. Under the Act of Queen Anne,
vessels of 400 tons took five apprentices; under the
Act of 1835, only two. Formerly ships of 1400 tons
were obliged to take fifteen apprentices; whereas,
under the present Act, the largest ship built was only
required to take five: so that the lesser amount of
tonnage in 1793 gave a larger supply of fresh hands
than the 4,000,000 tons.</p>

<p>The admiral did not fail to point out, in comparing
the two periods, that the increase to 4,000,000 exhibited
a noble proof of our commercial growth under
the protection of the Navigation Laws, and seemed
to warn us of what we hazarded in giving up 4,000,000
of shipping tonnage to be scrambled for by all the
nations of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and of impressment.</div>

<p>A more important and alarming view of the subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
was the encouragement held out to the shipowner to
believe that, among other changes contemplated, his
men would be no longer subject to impressment. If
that were to be the case, asked, pertinently, Admiral
Martin, what was the use of increased numbers, the
presumed result of increased tonnage, if the men were
locked up, and, thus, were not at once available for
the navy?<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to repeat Admiral Martin’s
further remarks concerning apprentices. I may,
however, state that he considered the complaints
against them but a “plausible grievance” of a few
shipowners. Apprentices, he held, were not much
expense, for though they ate as much as men, they
soon became active and useful in the ship, performing
a man’s duty without wages. They were, besides,
the cheapest people to shipowners, who in war time
were glad enough to have their full number of them,
because, as apprentices, they were in fact so many
hands protected from impressment. The number
of fresh hands required to keep up the stock of
seamen was very considerable; for the hard life of
sailors tells early on human strength, and the perils
of their pursuit contributes much to the waste of
life. The Admiral, therefore, held that law which
compelled shipowners to take apprentices was a most
valuable part of the Navigation Laws, and ought
not on any account to be given up: and that a
constant influx of young blood into the sea service
was essential to the interests of a naval country, and
any diminution of the present number of apprentices
in proportion to the existing tonnage would, in his
opinion, be detrimental to the navy, and hazardous
to our national security.</p>

<p>With regard to the quality of the supply from the
commercial to the military navy of this country, and
to the comparative value of those who had been
brought up in the merchant service, or of those who
entered the navy for the first time, Admiral Martin
unhesitatingly said, that the real practical seaman
was the north country sailor; but that the coasting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
sailor and the South Sea-fishery sailor were now very
scarce, if we had not lost the latter altogether.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
of Admiral
Berkeley,</div>

<p>Captain Maurice Frederick Fitzhardinge Berkeley,
R.N., who also gave evidence, entered into various
explanations concerning the effect of bounties, and of
the impressment of seamen, and approved the practice
by which seamen in foreign parts could enter
her Majesty’s ships without being deemed deserters:
he admitted, however, that if he were a captain in a
merchant vessel “he might probably think it a hard
case.” He took care to remark that “the fault was
not always with the men;” and, at the same time,
gave a different testimony to that of Sir James Stirling
about the proportion of merchant seamen who
served on board men-of-war. In his opinion, two-fifths
of the navy had been brought up in the merchant
service; while a good many who had commenced
life in it as boys, had subsequently gone into the
merchant service. With respect to the registry
system, he remarked that in the Jews’ shops at Shadwell,
and in similar places at Bristol, sailors could
purchase as many register-tickets as they wanted,
and, for half the amount of the fine, that would be
asked of them if they went to the Custom House.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">and of Mr.
R. B.
Minturn.</div>

<p>Mr. Robert B. Minturn, an eminent merchant and
shipowner of New York, was the last witness examined
before the Committee of the Lords. He was
owner of portions of many ships, and part owner in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>the lines of packets between New York and London,
and between New York and Liverpool. He traded
also with India and China, and was also owner of
whalers which went to the South Seas. Like most
others of the high-class merchants trading to foreign
countries, he was neither concerned in the inland
trade of the United States nor the coasting trade.
Having furnished evidence as to the progress of
American tonnage, he stated that the New York
packets, which were universally acknowledged to be
the best description of ships built in the United
States, having all of them a portion of live oak in
them, cost, exclusively of their cabins, about $70 per
ton, equal to about 14<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per ton, sterling. In this
estimate it must be remarked that the American
tonnage differs from our own.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Details
about
American
ships.</div>

<p>The American classification of ships also differs
from that at Lloyd’s. There the rating depends on
the age, the material, its quality, together with the
quantity of the fastenings, whether copper or iron,
and the mode of workmanship. The oak used in
New York comes principally from Virginia, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>live oak entirely from Florida; and the sheathing-copper
and iron are those supplied from England,
iron from other countries then paid a duty of 30 per
cent.: sheathing-copper was free of duty, but cake
or pig-copper, from which bolts are manufactured in
America, paid 5 per cent. Sails were, till recently,
brought from England, Holland, and Russia; but
hemp-canvas was then being made in America.
Cotton sail-cloth had for a long time been used to a
considerable extent.</p>

<p>Shipwrights’ wages in the United States were then
$2½ a day, about 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> sterling. In New York,
these artificers work only ten hours per day on new
work, and nine hours on old work; but repairs of
ships were more expensive in England than in the
United States. In the equipment, as we have seen,
of American ships, great attention was paid to
lessening manual labour by capstans, winches, and
other contrivances; and as they were much more
lightly rigged in proportion to their tonnage, they
were sailed with fewer men; the average number
being about two and a half sailors to every 100 tons
in a packet ship ranging from 900 to 1200 tons; but
in a common American freighting ship, where despatch
was of less importance, the proportion is even smaller.
For instance, the <i>Henry Clay</i>, already mentioned,
1207 tons, American, and 1467 tons, English, had
thirty seamen, two boys, and a carpenter, besides the
captain, four mates, cook, and steward: 40 all told.</p>

<p>With regard to the payment of the American
captains, it is not the practice to pay them by time,
but by some advantage in the voyage. In foreign
freighting voyages the captains depend chiefly on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
primage, which is 5 per cent. upon the amount of the
freight. That is usually their chief source of emolument;
but they, generally, receive also $30 a month
wages. This, of course, gives them an interest in
prosecuting the voyage successfully, and in stimulating
their men to exertion; but, with great good taste, Mr.
Minturn excused himself from making a comparison
between American and other ships; he strenuously,
however, denied that any national feeling influenced
the merchants in the least degree with respect to the
freighting their goods from England in American
bottoms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reciprocity
treaties</div>

<div class="sidenote">so far as
they affect
Americans.</div>

<p>With regard to the effect on America of the reciprocity
treaties to which I have already alluded,
and which came into operation shortly prior to 1830,
it would appear that though the Government of the
United States proposed to all foreign nations that, if
they would open their ports to American shipping,
they might enjoy all the benefits of their foreign
trade, the shipowners were distrustful of the operation
of this Free-trade system, as it was chiefly embraced
by the States of the north of Europe, which
had no commerce to offer in return. Hence efforts
were continually made to rescind these treaties; but
the experience of their operation has been that the
American commerce has increased in a much greater
ratio since that period than it had done before. The
reciprocity treaties have not, indeed, promoted the
growth of American tonnage; but, on the other
hand, they have not retarded it; and if the shipowners
in the United States do not avow their error,
at all events their opposition has now ceased. Mr.
Minturn was far from acknowledging that the Americans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
had gained by these treaties; indeed, he gave
a positive opinion that they had nothing to do with
the increase of United States shipping. No new
markets had been opened, but commerce with all
the world had increased, and probably nowhere so
much as with England. The chief extension of the
commerce of the United States with South America
was with the Brazils, which was enhanced owing to
the consumption of coffee, the duty on which had
been taken off, the result being that the American
consumption had doubled within ten years.</p>

<p>The temperance system adopted on board the American
vessels had resulted in the greatest possible
advantage, both in the efficiency and discipline of
the crews; and, with these, in the increased safety
of the ship and consequent diminution in the rates of
insurance. Indeed, Mr. Minturn stated that American
underwriters attached so much importance to
it, that at the commencement of this reform they
encouraged it by offering to return 10 per cent. on
the premium, on all vessels that performed a voyage
without the use of ardent spirits.</p>

<p>Such are a few of the leading points of evidence
furnished to the Lords’ Committee, who adjourned
<i>sine die</i> on the 6th July, 1848.</p>

practically also, all the ports of Holland.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_89" href="#FNanchor_89" class="label">[89]</a> One of the most remarkable incidents of the manning of a ship of
war is that of Sir Edward Pellew and H.M.S. <i>Nymphe</i>. When war
was declared by the French in February, 1793, it was unexpected;
and the navy was on a peace establishment of only 16,000 sailors and
marines. It was necessary at once to increase this number to 60,000.
Pellew, finding it impossible to get seamen for his frigate, at once put
eighty Cornish miners on board his ship, and a few months later
fought and won the celebrated action with the <i>Cleopatra</i>—most of his
crew never having seen a shot fired before. (See Osler’s ‘Life of
Viscount Exmouth.’)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90" class="label">[90]</a> There belonged, in round numbers, to the United Kingdom and
her colonies and possessions on the 1st January, 1875, 7,500,000 tons
of merchant vessels: of these about 2,000,000 tons were steam vessels;
and as each of these will perform the work of four sailing vessels, it
may be said that we now possess in our merchant service an equivalent
to 13,500,000 registered tons of sailing shipping, so that in twenty-five
years we have more than trebled Admiral Martin’s highest estimate.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91" class="label">[91]</a> The question of impressment is too important to be passed over
without any notice. Every well-constituted mind holds the principle of
impressment in abhorrence; but every reflecting statesman is aware
of the immense importance of such a power, especially as it is never
brought into use but when the country is in actual peril. Admiral
Martin, in his evidence, furnished his experience of what impressment
had practically done for us in times past, he having been in three
armaments, 1787, 1790, and 1791, on all of which occasions the equipment
of the fleet was like magic<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>, and the effect of the prompt
display of the gigantic naval strength of this country in each case
saved the expenditure of thousands of lives and millions of money. If
these objects be worthy of national regard, we must submit to the
mortification of sanctioning even so great a trespass on the liberty of
the subject. The event of 1790, Admiral Martin thought, deserves
especial mention as showing distinctly what the nation gained by
impressment, and the results of a great naval demonstration. A
quarrel had at that time arisen, though, perhaps, from an insignificant
cause, with the Court of Spain; it became, however, of the greatest
importance, owing to the threatened alliance of France, then under the
control of the National Assembly, with the Court of the Escurial. On
the 2nd of May, the King in Council authorized the issue of warrants
of impressment of seafaring men, and, in the middle of June, Admiral
Barrington put to sea with a large division of the fleet. It was insisted
that this could never have been accomplished except by the power of
impressment; and Admiral Martin, doubtless, expressed the general
opinion of his profession in stating as his sincere belief that “if we
lost the power of impressment we should lose the country.” Yet, while
urging the necessity of preserving the power of impressment, he also
maintained that nothing should be left undone which could tend to
render the practice as infrequent as possible, and that every exertion
should be made to render the service itself attractive to the seamen.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_92" href="#FNanchor_92" class="label">[92]</a> In 1787, we equipped a fleet to support the Stadtholder. In 1790, we had
a misunderstanding with Spain about Nootka Sound; and in 1791, we raised a
naval armament to check the ambition of Russia.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_93" href="#FNanchor_93" class="label">[93]</a> By the law then in force every seaman, before he could be employed
on board a merchant ship, was required to produce a certificate from
the officer of the Registrar of Seamen, called a register-ticket, showing
that he was duly qualified for his duties, either as able or ordinary
seaman; but the system was found to be impracticable, and was so
grossly abused that it has since been abolished.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_94" href="#FNanchor_94" class="label">[94]</a> In the United States the old English measurement is still adhered
to, and the poops of ships are not measured, which accounts for much
of the difference observable in the measurement of British and American
ships. For example, the <i>Henry Clay</i>, of 1207 tons American measurement,
where the poop was not included, measured 1467 tons by
the new English mode, on which light, dock, and other dues are
charged. The ship <i>Queen of the West</i>, 1106 tons American, measured
for light dues in Liverpool, 1270 tons English. The effect of this
would be that the calculation of $70 per ton would be diminished
in a corresponding ratio if taken in English tonnage, and with the
poops included. The estimate of $70 per ton, that is, American
measurement, applies to the cost of a ship with her spars and sails,
rigging, and everything complete ready to receive a cargo, but without
her sea stores.</p>

<p>Although the shipowners appear to have placed
much confidence in the House of Lords, they saw
that unless they could convince the Commons that
the repeal of the Navigation Laws would be prejudicial
to the interests of England, they would have
no hope of maintaining the <i>status quo</i>: and, further,
that no modification would satisfy the demands of
the Free-traders, who, strong in their principles,
consequently repudiated all compromise with Protectionists.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Motion of
Mr. Herries,
1848.</div>

<p>One of the most earnest leaders of the latter class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
had just re-entered the House of Commons after a
long absence from it. Mr. Herries had been Chancellor
of the Exchequer so long before as 1828. He
was an able and honest Conservative; sound in his
principles and earnest in everything he undertook.
To him, therefore, the Protectionist shipowners in
their hour of trial appealed for aid; nor did they
appeal in vain. Mr. Herries was heart and soul with
them. He saw nothing but ruin and desolation in
the abolition of these ancient laws. They had, in his
judgment, been tampered with and weakened by
Huskisson, and now they were about to be destroyed
by such men as Cobden, Bright, Ricardo, and Milner
Gibson, backed, alas! “by his old friend and colleague,
Sir Robert Peel.” No wonder, therefore, that he
buckled on his armour with vigour for the fight; and,
soon after the debate on the resolution of the Government,
he submitted, though on a separate occasion, the
following counter-resolution:—“That it is essential to
the national interests of the country to maintain the
fundamental principles of the existing Navigation
Laws, subject to such modifications as may be best
calculated to obviate any proved inconvenience to the
commerce of the United Kingdom and its dependencies
without danger to our national strength.”</p>

<p>This resolution had been framed with great care.
It had been the subject of unusual consideration by
the Shipowners’ Society of London, then the oracle
of all the other Protectionist societies in England,
whose object was the maintenance of the Navigation
Laws; and, in their opinion, the maritime greatness
of England depended upon its success. If defeated,
“Rule Britannia” would for ever be expunged from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
our national songs; the glories of Duncan and
Nelson would “wither like the aspen-leaf, and fade
like the Tyrian dye;” and, as none but “Yankees,
Swedes, Danes, and Norwegian sailors would be
found in our ports, who, they demanded, would there
be to fight our battles and defend our sea-girt
shores?” These were, then, no mere words of
course; they were the honest expressions of the
thoughts of earnest men, who, however mistaken
in their views, or perhaps in some instances blinded
by what they conceived to be self-interest, firmly
believed that the power and greatness of their native
land depended on the preservation of the Navigation
Laws.</p>

<p>The counter-declaration of Mr. Herries was therefore
introduced with the sole object of getting rid
of the Ministerial measure, failing that, of modifying
it in such a manner as not to abrogate the
principle of these laws. Hence he embodied in his
speech all the leading arguments of the advocates of
a restrictive policy. Thus, after alluding to the proceedings
of the committee of the previous year,
Mr. Herries found fault with Government for having,
without further inquiry, announced in the Speech
from the Throne their evident intentions, however
vaguely worded, of making an entire change in the
maritime policy of Great Britain. Six months had
elapsed and Ministers had proposed no measure; while
the House of Lords, acting more wisely, had instituted
the further inquiry then going on, a portion of
the evidence taken having been already laid before
the House of Commons. If, argued Mr. Herries, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
Lords should, from the evidence taken before them,
resolve on the maintenance of those laws and on the
rejection of the Government measure, such a course
might occasion embarrassment. He complained that
while the British shipowner would be exposed to
foreign competition by the removal of all protection,
the heavy burden of being required to man his ship
agreeably with the rules of the Navigation Laws
was still retained. Criticising in succession the
various pleas in behalf of Prussia, America, and our
West Indian Colonies, for the repeal or modification
of the present code, he remarked that Prussia had
nothing to give us in return for the concessions she
sought, and that her warnings and threats of withdrawing
such advantages as she had already conceded
were of trivial moment. America, in the
most friendly way, no doubt, requested to participate
in our foreign and colonial trade, in return for reciprocal
concessions to be made to us: but America
had no colonies; and it was wholly out of her
power to give us any equivalent for the advantages
she would be sure to acquire by the abolition
of our Navigation Laws. “Why did not ‘free’
America,” he exclaimed, “show us an example, and
abolish her laws, which were quite as stringent as
ours?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protectionist
principles
stated.</div>

<p>As to the West Indies, Mr. Herries gave many
details in proof of his assertion that the petition
against the Navigation Laws from the Jamaica House
of Assembly but imperfectly represented the real
sentiments of either that body or of the island at
large. Had its promoters been aware that, by the
abrogation of these laws, freights from the foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
islands (whence sugar was brought to England, as
well as from the British Islands) would be materially
lowered, they never would have assented to it. To
facilitate importations from Cuba by an alteration of
the Navigation Laws would only aggravate the disadvantages
from which they were at present suffering.
Relying on the authority of Mr. Huskisson, he
quoted him for a definition of that Protective principle
he was willing to stand by; a principle which
would reserve our colonial, coasting, and fishing trade
wholly to ourselves, while protecting our foreign
trade, so far as was consistent with our relations and
engagements with foreign countries. If the House
were agreed on the general principle of protecting
our marine, Mr. Herries argued that it might, in
committee, remove those anomalies which in some
quarters were so much the object of censure and
ridicule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extent of
the shipping
trade.</div>

<p>He reminded the House that the tonnage of the
vessels belonging to this kingdom and her colonies
then amounted to 3,900,000 tons; the number of
sailors employed in our mercantile marine, to
230,000; and the capital embarked in shipping, to
little less than 40,000,000<i>l.</i>; while the trades immediately
connected therewith, or subservient to
the shipping interest, employed a capital of from
16,000,000<i>l.</i> to 17,000,000<i>l.</i> In this way there was
between 50,000,000<i>l.</i> and 60,000,000<i>l.</i> of property
which would be immediately affected by the proposed
change. In this branch of national industry
about 50,000 artisans, whose wages amounted to
5,000,000<i>l.</i> a-year, were employed; while the cost
of victualling the ships he estimated at 9,000,000<i>l.</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
and the freights the mercantile marine earned per
annum at nearly 30,000,000<i>l.</i><a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">National
defences
endangered.</div>

<p>These were enormous interests, he exclaimed, and
ought not to be dealt with lightly; but when, in addition
to all this, it was considered that the existence
of these interests lay at the foundation of our national
defences, and, that without these defences, we
could not maintain our present position as a nation,
surely there were ample reasons, if not for resisting
all change, at least for adopting such changes as
appeared necessary, not in the reckless way now
proposed, by a sweeping resolution for the entire
abolition of the Navigation Laws, but by improving,
altering, and modifying them in such a manner as
would be consistent with the great interest they were
framed to protect. He therefore prayed the House
not to assent to experimental changes, which might
impair the strength of the right arm this nation had
hitherto put forth to awe and control the world,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>and convert it into a palsied limb, with which the
meanest of our rivals might successfully grapple.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Labouchere’s
reply.</div>

<p>Mr. Labouchere followed in an elaborate speech, in
general support of the Ministerial measure, but at the
same time admitting that the real point for the decision
of the House was fairly raised by Mr. Herries’
resolution. “Would they, however,” he asked, “be
content with patchwork legislation? Was it in fact
right to maintain the principle of the Navigation
Laws? or were they prepared to consider the propriety
of departing from those principles, so as to
conciliate the wants of commerce and the exigencies
of the case before them, with a view of adapting
them to the spirit of the times, and of meeting the
just demands of other countries, the wishes of our
own colonies, and the interests of our expanding
trade?” Of course, if Mr. Herries carried his resolution,
it would be fatal to the measure of the Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alderman
Thompson.</div>

<p>Alderman Thompson, an opulent merchant extensively
engaged in the iron trade, supported the Protectionist
view of the question. He ridiculed the
plan submitted by Sir James Stirling for manning
the navy as “Utopian,” proposing as this plan did to
train up a race of seamen exclusively for the navy, and,
therefore irrespectively of the commercial marine.
“Would Mr. Hume,” he asked, directing his remarks
towards that gentleman, “sanction a vote for 120,000
men during peace?” He warned the House against
the effect on our colonial shipping trade should it
be thus thrown open to the Americans, whose ships,
he said, already supplied our West Indian settlements
with the whole of the lumber required by them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
though under the disadvantage of returning from
their ports in ballast. Various speakers on both
sides followed during several adjourned debates:
Dr. Bowring, Mr. Moffatt, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson,
and Mr. Milner Gibson, on the side of repeal; Mr.
H. J. Baillie, Mr. Scott, Mr. Robinson, the Marquess
of Granby, and Mr. Henley on that of Protection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Gladstone’s
views.</div>

<p>On the 2nd June, Mr. Gladstone, then sitting with
Sir Robert Peel on the cross-benches, resumed the
debate in a most exhaustive speech. His views were
not in exact accordance with either party in the
debate, but he took the affirmative side on the broad
question of repeal as a matter of reasonable expediency,
although, on the specific scheme of Government
he gave only a qualified opinion, as he would
have preferred a more gradual measure. He wished
Government had adhered to the uniform course of
precedents, making large concessions conditional upon
reciprocal action by other Powers. He objected to
the discretionary power of the Queen in Council,
with a view of extorting reciprocity, a discretion at
once too large and too delicate: if it were really
intended that this power should be a living and practical
one, to be put in force in case of need, he thought
it would be wiser and safer to undo, bit by bit, the
system we have got, than to sweep it away in order
to reconstruct it piecemeal; and then, perhaps shortly
afterwards, to pull it down again. With that keen
foresight for which he has ever been distinguished,
he particularly censured that part of the plan which
reserved the coasting trade. He contended that the
American coasting trade was of the highest value,
and equivalent to a colonial trade. “Let us give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
her our coasting trade, and we are entitled, not
merely in policy but in justice, to ask her for her
coasting trade. But let us give her the colonial trade
without the coasting trade, and we give her the
valuable boon, while we withhold the worthless;
but we cannot say to her, ‘Give us all, for we have
given you all.’” Mr. Gladstone relied on the sincerity
of the American diplomatist, and therefore,
urged this point as one of the highest importance,
Mr. Bancroft’s offer appearing to him a forcible argument
for including the coasting trade in any future
arrangement. In conclusion, he expressed the hope
that when England and America had concurred in
setting an example to the world of free navigation,
other nations would be induced to imitate it by a
moral force it would be difficult to resist; and that
we should live to see the ocean, that great highway
of nations, as free as the ships that traverse its
bosom, or the winds that blow over it.</p>

<p>Though Mr. Gladstone would have preferred securing
such reciprocal privileges as other nations
had power to confer before throwing open our ports
to their ships, his speech was in effect a splendid
declamation in favour of Free-trade principles, as
applied to navigation; and his argument pointed to
the conclusion that, even if other nations were not
prepared for reciprocity, it would still be for the interests
of Great Britain to repeal her restrictive laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Hudson.</div>

<p>Mr. Hudson, as the representative of Sunderland,
apart from his own Conservative principles, made an
earnest appeal to the House against Free-trade in
navigation, and hoped it would not be led away by
any fanciful notions. Captain Berkeley, on the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
hand, expressed an opinion rather favourable to the
Government measure, though, should it become law,
he feared, with most of his brother naval officers, that
there would be a difficulty in manning the Royal
Navy. But Mr. J. Clay, though an extreme Free-trader,
refused to support the Government till all
restrictions on shipowners, who had great influence at
Hull, which he so long represented, were removed.
Mr. Newdegate opposed the Government scheme in
an elaborate speech; and the then member for
South Shields, though sitting opposite, followed in
the same line with a brief but argumentative address.
Lord Ingestrie and Mr. R. Hildyard likewise denounced
the measure; while Lord John Hay predicted
eventual success by its adoption. A division was
then taken, after three nights’ debate (May 29th,
June 1st and 2nd), on the question that the debate
be now adjourned, which was carried by a majority
of 163—the numbers being 236 to 73.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June the debate was resumed by Sir
J. Walsh, who had carried the adjournment, when
Mr. Miles and Sir Charles Burrell spoke on the same
side against repeal. The most prominent speakers
on the Free-trade side were Mr. Cardwell, Sir George
Clerk, and Sir Charles Wood; Mr. Cardwell thinking
the time had arrived for a judicious relaxation of the
Navigation Laws, and Sir Charles Wood noticing the
very general concurrence in favour of some change.
The debate, however, did not close, though the subject
seemed exhausted, but was adjourned for the
fourth time, and the last night called forth some of
the most powerful speeches which had yet been
delivered on the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord
George
Bentinck.</div>

<p>Lord George Bentinck resumed the debate on the
9th of June, and defended the shipmasters against the
aspersions cast upon them by Mr. James Wilson, who
had described them as unable to obtain freights from
Rio Janeiro, on account of the bad character they
bore for carelessness in the carriage or delivery of
goods entrusted to their charge, and concluded one
of the best speeches he ever delivered by pointing
out the danger of repeal, as the seamen could not in
future be pressed into our service when the day of
difficulty and danger might arise. “Let us cherish
our brave seamen,” exclaimed the noble Lord; “show
them that, alike in peace and in war, we will provide
for them; that we scorn to weigh in the balance
with the comforts, the prosperity, and happiness of
our gallant defenders, the miserable saving of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
per ton upon the freight of our shipping, and the
eighteenth part of a farthing per pound on our sugar
and coffee, and then we may again, as heretofore,
boldly challenge and safely defy all the nations of
the earth.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Hume.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Cobden.</div>

<p>Mr. Hume supported the Ministerial measure,
and pressed upon the Government the necessity
of removing every burden on British ships to which
foreigners were not liable. Admiral Bowles spoke
on the opposite side; and Mr. Cobden, following,
asked, why should not the sailor in his ship, as
well as the workman in his factory, or the labourer
on his farm, be able to compete with foreigners?
He then appealed to the evidence, showing, as this
did, that we could build better ships than foreign
nations, and at as cheap a rate, quality considered;
sail them as well; take greater care of their cargoes;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
and secure greater punctuality and despatch; adding,
that our sailors had the greatest natural aptitude for
the sea of any in the world. The only drawbacks, he
continued, were of a moral kind, insubordination and
drunkenness; but these would yield to better culture.
We heard a great outcry about the burdens of the
landowner, such as county-rates, highway-rates, poor-rates,
and church-rates; but the shipowner paid none
of these, being exempted from any such burdens.
Therefore, on the score of taxation, the shipowner
and the sailor were infinitely better able to compete
with the foreigner than any other class of the community.
Mr. Cobden then reviewed the position of
the shipbuilder, the shipowner, and the sailor, and
contended that they had no need to fear competition
with the foreigner. He regretted that the power of
retaliation should be given to the Queen in Council,
not that he believed it would ever be acted upon,
and, after repudiating the boastful language so frequently
held respecting England’s naval supremacy,
he asked, “was this a time to be always singing ‘Rule
Britannia’?” concluding his remarks by stating,
with great wisdom, that constant assertion of maritime
supremacy was calculated to provoke kindred
passions in other nations; whereas, if Great Britain
enunciated the doctrines of peace, she would invoke
similar sentiments from the rest of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Disraeli.</div>

<p>Mr. Disraeli, at that time exhibiting no mean promise
of future distinction, delivered an eloquent
speech, illustrated with that brilliant rhetoric, sarcastic
humour and point, for which he has been ever
famous in debate. There was nothing, he said, more
fatal to national interests than the recklessness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
ignorance. He would not, indeed, sing “Rule Britannia,”
for fear of distressing Mr. Cobden, but he did
not think the House would <i>encore</i> “Yankee Doodle.”
Mr. Labouchere had described this as the age of
“commerce, peace, and internal improvement;” on
the contrary, it was, in his opinion, the age of no
trade, of intended war, and of communists tearing up
railways. Naples is in a state of siege, he exclaimed;
Paris in insurrection; Vienna in revolt; Berlin barricaded;
four pitched battles have been fought in
Europe in eight weeks, and the Baltic and the
Adriatic are alike blockaded, so that Mr. Cobden
himself could scarcely be so devout a believer as he
pretended in the quiet of nations without arms.
“At least,” concluded Mr. Disraeli, “I will not incur
the responsibility by my vote of endangering that
empire gained by so much valour, and guarded by so
much vigilance—that empire broader than both the
Americas, and richer than the farthest Ind, which
was foreshadowed in its infancy by the genius of a
Blake, and consecrated in its culminating glory by
the blood of a Nelson—the empire of the seas.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Robert
Peel.</div>

<p>At this stage of the debate Sir Robert Peel, who
had been silently waiting to express his opinions,
rose to address the House. On rising he had to encounter
an unusual demonstration of hostility from
the Protectionist benches; and for the first few
sentences these unseemly interruptions continued;
but he soon imposed silence upon his opponents by
turning round disdainfully and saying, “this is not a
matter to be disposed of by clamour, but by deliberate
reason. It is possible the opinions I avow may
be erroneous, but, depend on it, you show no confidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
in the strength of your own if you have no
better answer to give me than boisterous clamour.”
This appeal to be answered by arguments alone
secured the ex-minister a hearing. His speech, however,
was not one of his happiest efforts. He went
over the same ground as preceding speakers, referring
to many parts of the evidence, produced mainly to
show that England need not fear competition even
with the Americans; he warned the House that the
claims of Canada could not be long resisted, remarking
that it will benefit Parliament to examine into
the state of the Navigation Laws, with a view to an
extensive alteration of them. He, however, avoided
giving a direct opinion on many essential points;
and, with respect to the policy of opening the coasting
trade or continuing the restriction, he reserved
his views for the present. Nor did he offer any
opinion as to the policy of requiring for every
“British ship” that three-fourths of the crew should
be British seamen. He also reserved his judgment
as to the mode by which Government proposed to
make the alterations: his first impression being to
proceed by reciprocity treaties, and to make concessions
to such Powers as were willing to make equivalent
concessions to us. On the other hand, it
did not escape him that these reciprocity treaties
were themselves sources of constant trouble. The
“favoured-nation clause,” he added, seems simple
enough, but when you come to act on it, practically,
these treaties involve us in great difficulties. There
was, he said, an admitted difference between the case
of differential duties on navigation and on the imports
of goods under a tariff. And he felt that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
was most difficult to determine whether the concessions
any given country is willing to make, or has
the power to make, are equivalent to those made by
some other, the commercial demands and commercial
produce of which may be of a totally different nature.
Again, with regard to reciprocity treaties, great
difficulty he thought might ensue in the event of
war; and the power Government proposed to retain
of re-imposing restrictive duties would be found
very difficult to exercise. It would in his judgment
invert the relations between the Crown and the
Parliament. The House of Commons would be
favourable, and relax, the Crown would restrain.
The House of Commons would give universal privileges,
and in the course of four or five years the invidious
duty would be thrown upon the Crown of
withdrawing privileges the House of Commons had
granted. Sir Robert, to avoid this ungracious duty,
threw out the hint that the Act should be made
limited in duration, so as to come again before Parliament.
Suppose, he suggested, the trade were to be
opened for five years; at the end of that period the
privileges given would necessarily expire, and every
country would have notice that they had the means
of averting the re-establishment of restrictions by
entering into some further arrangement with this
country. He preferred to see the object effected in
that way rather than by new reciprocity treaties; in
short, that America, as well as other nations, should
do what she had proposed by legislation rather than
by treaty.</p>

<p>There was some renewal of hostile interruption at
the conclusion of Sir Robert’s speech; but it seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
clear that he felt by no means disposed to run at
once a race with the Whigs in a Free-trade policy
as regarded navigation; at least, it was evident from
his speech that his mind was not then made up on
many essential points, and, further, that he had
doubts as to the wisdom or expediency of immediate
and unconditional repeal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The resolution
carried
by
117,</div>

<p>This important and remarkable debate was closed
by a short speech from Lord John Russell, who apparently
did not then take that interest in the question
which might have been expected from his
position as Prime Minister, and considering the views
he had long entertained on all the great questions of
progress. The House then went to a division on
Mr. Herries’ amendment, or rather on the previous
question, when there appeared, Ayes 294, Noes 177,
being a majority of 117 in favour of going into
committee upon the Navigation Laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">but
abandoned
for a time.</div>

<p>By this decision the ground was cleared for the
Ministerial measure; but as the above result was not
arrived at until the 9th June, it was manifestly hopeless
to expect that any Bill could be carried through
both Houses of Parliament during that session; the
more so as the Committee of the House of Lords was
still sitting. Hence many who were anxious for a
settlement, seeing the great majority by which the
resolution was carried, censured Government for
having delayed the measure until so late a period of
the session. During the ensuing month, however,
the subject was avoided on both sides; the Lords’
Committee adjourned <i>sine die</i>, with no other result
than the printing of the evidence; and on the 10th
August, when Mr. Labouchere laid his resolution in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
form upon the table, he announced the intention of
Ministers to abandon the measure for the present
session, hoping to re-introduce the subject at an early
period the following year. In fact, a tacit understanding
had been come to by all parties that the
struggle should be deferred, and, in this spirit, Mr.
Labouchere carefully avoided any remark that might
lead to discussion. He, however, announced his intention
of bringing in a Bill <i>pro formâ</i>, as preferable
to making any further official statement. The
original resolution was then laid on the table unopposed,
although Mr. Gladstone criticised its form,
and Mr. Robinson denied that the House had affirmed
the principle of the Government measure; they had,
he said, only negatived the counter-resolution proposed
by Mr. Herries. So jealous, indeed, were
the Protectionists, that they would not allow the
resolution to be laid upon the table till the Minister
had given his assurance that no evasion should be
practised, and that the Bill should be exactly in
conformity with Mr. Labouchere’s resolution. The
original Bill bears date 16th August, 1848, and was
prepared and brought in by Mr. Bernal, Mr. Labouchere,
and Lord John Russell. It was entitled “A
Bill to amend the laws in force for the Encouragement
of British Shipping and Navigation.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Its
provisions were strictly in accordance with Mr.
Labouchere’s statement and resolution, and reserved
the coasting and colonial coasting trade, with power
of retaliation against foreigners who might decline
to reciprocate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Temper of
Shipowners.</div>

<p>Thus ended the first great Parliamentary struggle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>of 1848. The shipowners had so far succeeded that
they had staved off, for a while, the impending danger;
but the great majority in the Commons declaring it
expedient to revise the existing laws, left no doubt
on any reasonable mind that a sweeping change
would be effected in the ensuing session.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed that the main question
in any proposed alteration of the Navigation Laws
was, whether foreign countries, and especially the
United States, would respond to our liberal policy,
and, in a spirit of fairness, make such alterations in
their navigation laws, tonnage dues, and tariff, as
would promote increased commercial intercourse on
the footing of an honourable competition. Of course
the Protectionists did not assent to all this; but the
temper of the House of Commons plainly indicated
that a great relaxation of restriction was inevitable,
the only real doubt being as to the best mode of
securing reciprocity. The Ministers of the Crown
saw clearly that the shipowners were alarmed at the
vast change threatened, while the periodical press,
during the autumn of 1848, teemed with the most
alarming statements of impending ruin to all classes
connected with ships and navigation. The Shipowners’
Society gave extensive circulation to a variety
of fugitive publications, all advocating the defence of
the national interests and condemning indiscriminate
repeal. On the other hand, there were many whose
authors were strongly in favour of reciprocity;<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>number in favour of total and unconditional repeal
being comparatively few. But as “Repeal,” or “No
Repeal,” was the popular cry, it became more and more
manifest that unless some pledge were given that
foreign nations would reciprocate our concessions, it
would be difficult, with all the influence of the Free-trade
party, to carry the Bill through Parliament,
and especially through the Upper House.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Efforts of
ministers
to obtain
reciprocity
by a circular
from
the
Foreign
Office.</div>

<p>It became, therefore, of the utmost importance to
extract from Foreign Powers some intimation of their
intentions. Hence Lord Palmerston, in his own
name, addressed a circular from the Foreign Office,
dated 22nd December, 1848, to her Majesty’s diplomatic
agents in various countries, requesting information
on those points.</p>

<p>In this circular, Lord Palmerston informed his
agents that the measure for modifying the Navigation
Laws would be again submitted to Parliament
on its re-assembling; and, as the principle of some
modification had been practically accepted, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
was no doubt that many extensive measures would
receive the sanction of Parliament. These diplomatic
agents were furnished with a statement of the
existing Navigation Laws, and of the Registry Acts,
together with a notice of the changes proposed;
these being the sweeping away all existing restrictions,
with the exception of those directly relating
to the coasting trade of Great Britain and of the
British possessions abroad, all other trades being
thus opened to vessels of all nations. The Bill had,
in fact, left to all foreign British possessions power
either to open their own coasting trade, if they
should think fit, or to regulate that trade with the
consent of the Queen in Council. It also gave them
power to deal in like manner with the trade between
one colony and another.</p>

<p>It was likewise explained that ample powers were
reserved by the Crown for the imposition of differential
duties, prohibitions, and restrictions, on
ships of such countries as should still subject British
ships to various duties, restrictions, or prohibitions.
It was further intended that the Bill should not come
into operation for some months after the day on which
it was passed, in order that Government might have
time to ascertain the dispositions of Foreign Powers,
and be able to frame proper orders for such differential
duties as might be required whenever the
intended relaxations should take effect towards ships
of such nations as were willing to adopt the principle
of reciprocity.</p>

<p>Finally, it was pointed out that, on the one hand,
the definition of a “British ship” was no longer to
signify one of British build; but only that she should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
be owned by a British subject, and be navigated by
a crew whereof three-fourths were British subjects;
the definition foreign ship being purposely omitted,
in order that any ship acknowledged by the law of
a particular country to be a ship of such country
should be also recognised as a ship of that country
by British law.</p>

<p>With this view, Lord Palmerston desired the diplomatic
agents to inform him what restrictions were
actually in force against British vessels at such countries
where they were resident, what voyages they
might engage in (with the goods they might carry),
and what differential duties or charges, direct or
indirect, they were liable to, from which the national
vessels were exempt, and, above all, whether
any further restrictions or differential duties were
then contemplated.</p>

<p>In this circular Lord Palmerston disclosed the intended
policy of the British Government, in that,
while not attempting to make the alteration in its
law strictly dependent on the legislation of other
countries, it was yet prepared to consider the general
policy of each State. His agents were, therefore,
instructed to ascertain whether the Governments to
which they were accredited would accept advances
on the part of Great Britain, with the object of
placing their ships on a footing of equality; the only
reservation being the coasting trade; or whether
they would require any particular privileges or exemptions
for their national vessels, thereby rendering
“it impossible for this country to concede to their
shipping the whole of the advantages which would,
under the contemplated measure, attach to the shipping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
of such States as may place British and national
vessels on a footing of more perfect equality.”</p>

<p>Practically, Lord Palmerston offered, on the part of
the British Government, to remove nearly all the
restrictions of the British Navigation Law, whenever
such a proposal was met in a spirit of corresponding
liberality, at the same time, however, reserving the
right to take such course as Government might
deem necessary where no such reciprocal feeling was
shown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reply
thereto of
America.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Buchanan’s
letter.</div>

<p>It is unnecessary to enter at great length into the
explanations given in reply by foreign Governments.
Some of these are, however, too important
to be omitted in a work of this kind. Pre-eminently
the disposition of the United States, or rather the
opinion of Congress, as well as of the Executive, was
essentially necessary to be known on this side of the
Atlantic. Consequently Mr. John F. Crampton, our
Envoy at Washington, lost no time in bringing the
question before the then American Secretary of State,
Mr. Buchanan.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> That gentleman in reply said, that
the most satisfactory answer he could give was to
furnish a copy of the first section of the Act of Congress,
approved on the <i>24th May, 1828</i>, intituled
“An Act, in addition to an Act intituled, ‘an Act
concerning discriminating Duties of Tonnage and
Import, and to equalise the duties on Prussian Vessels
and their Cargoes.’” The substance of this law
will be found in another part of this work,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and it
will be remembered that it conferred a power on the
American President to reciprocate by proclamation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
any abolition of discriminating duties of tonnage or
imports made by foreign nations. Mr. Buchanan
pointed out with just pride that Congress twenty
years previously had offered reciprocity of trade to
all the world, and that England might, by complying
with the fair and equitable conditions of that Act,
have at any moment placed her vessels and their
cargoes, both in our direct and indirect foreign trade,
on the same footing with those of America. Mr.
Buchanan added that, previously to 1828, reciprocity
in commerce and navigation had been practically
adopted by his Government in specific treaties with
Denmark, Sweden, the Hanseatic Republics, and
Prussia, and had since been carried out in other
treaties concluded with Austria, Russia, &amp;c., all of
these being still in force.</p>

<p>But the following remarkable observation made by
Mr. Buchanan at the close of his letter, gives conclusive
testimony that when Mr. Bancroft offered
“to give us all,” <i>i.e.</i> the coasting trade, this offer
was wholly unauthorized by the American Government.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
The words of Mr. Buchanan were: “I might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
add that the President, in accordance with the spirit
of this Act (of 1828) has already made a specific
proposal to Great Britain through Mr. Bancroft to
Lord Palmerston, dated 3rd November, 1847, to conclude
a treaty providing that “British ships may trade
from any port in the world to any port in the United
States, and be received, protected, and, in respect to
charges and duties, treated like American ships, if,
reciprocally, American ships may in like manner
trade from any port of the world to any port under
the dominion of her Britannic Majesty”: but <i>of course,
this proposal was not intended to embrace the coasting
trade of either country</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Mr. Buchanan did not confine
himself merely to this honest, frank disclaimer.
While his own opinions, as well as those of the
highly liberal and intelligent Secretary of the Treasury,
Mr. R. J. Walker, whose admirable report was
published at the same time, were decidedly in favour
of meeting the change proposed by reciprocal legislation,
he did not conceal from Mr. Crampton that
it was probable some difference of opinion would
manifest itself in Congress upon this question, from
the unwillingness felt in some quarters to throw
open the ship-building business in the United States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
to the formidable competition of British shipbuilders,
and more particularly to that of the shipbuilders of
the British North American colonies.</p>

<p>Many persons in England shared the apprehensions
expressed by Mr. Buchanan, especially those
who, having watched throughout the progress of the
agitation for the repeal of the Navigation Laws, were
aware of the strong Protectionist feelings then and
still prevalent on the seaboard of the States, though
not shared to the same extent by the non-navigating
classes: they did not, therefore, believe that Congress
would allow the President to put even the Act for
1828 in force without a serious struggle. However,
though no opposition was offered, the expressions of
Mr. Buchanan to Mr. Crampton warranted a reasonable
doubt lest, when it came to the point, whether
reciprocity would be granted to the ships of Great
Britain. That no difficulty was started on the other
side was mainly due to the meritorious reports of
Mr. Walker, whose zeal in the cause of freedom
of commerce and navigation deserves the highest
encomium.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reply of
other
Powers.</div>

<p>The application made to France with a view of
ascertaining the disposition of the Republic to enter
into a course of mutual Free-trade had no result. M.
Drouyn de Lhuys, in a letter dated 31st January, 1849,
(misdated 1848, see p. 209), complained of our partial
non-execution of the clauses of the Convention of
1826; but, as regarded future legislation, he said in
substance that, as in England the question was being
subjected to the gravest consideration, so in France,
now that her mission was to march in the way of
liberality, the greatest circumspection was necessary.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
The subject was referred to the competent authorities,
and a few vague words about a desire on the part of
the Republic to follow the principles of reciprocity
closed the despatch, for whatever the opinions of the
President may have been, the people of France were
not then prepared to recognise the principles of Free-trade.</p>

<p>Sardinia expressed a very honourable desire to
meet us on the basis of reciprocity. With Russia a
practical reciprocity already existed. In Austria no
differential duties existed between national and English
vessels. The answer, however, given by Count
Bülow on the part of Prussia was by no means satisfactory,
inasmuch as he could give no pledge as to
future legislation, the policy of Prussia being bound
up with the Zollverein States. The answer from
Belgium presented difficulties. That from Portugal
intimated general, but very equivocating and undecided,
Free-trade principles, to the effect that, as the
peculiarities of the commerce of the different nations
of Europe were so various, the Minister of Portugal
“could not believe in the complete acquiescence of
those same nations with the plan which England
proposed to follow.” A glance was directed to the
benefits of Free-trade, and Viscount de Castro added:
“But if this is not the time for restrictions, neither
can it be for Portugal that of reducing the few that
exist, as that would be the means of entirely destroying
the mercantile navy.” Lord Palmerston was,
however, consoled for the unfavourable answer by
the assurance of the Portuguese Government that
whatever were the facilities the nations of Europe
might adopt in correspondence with the Bill then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
under discussion in the British Parliament, England
would not obtain from any of those nations the
almost entire monopoly she then enjoyed in her
maritime intercourse with Portugal. The Viscount
de Castro hoped, therefore, that “in Council” no
exception would be made to injure the trade of
Portugal.</p>

<p>In spite of the want of success (and they received
but scanty support) Ministers met in their applications
to foreign countries for reciprocity, they resolutely
persevered in their policy, resting for their chief support
almost wholly on the Free-trade party in the
House of Commons. The principles of Free-trade
had become the established and predominant policy of
the nation, and navigation alone was the exceptional
branch which, until then, had successfully resisted
innovation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress
of Free-trade
views.</div>

<p>It was very remarkable, that in the celebrated Petition
of the London merchants to the House of Commons,
so far back as 1820,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> from which the Free-trade
movement may be dated, no mention is made of the
Navigation Laws. Mr. Tooke, who drew the petition,
directed chiefly attention to the then unacknowledged
fact that freedom from restraint was calculated to
give the utmost extension to foreign trade, and the
best direction to the capital and industry of the
country. That the maxim of buying in the cheapest
market and selling in the dearest, the rule of every
merchant in his individual dealings, was as strictly
applicable to the trade of the nation; but had Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
Tooke at that time hinted anything about navigation,
or the abrogation of the existing Navigation Laws,
he would have exposed himself almost to personal
danger. The success, however, of the Free-trade
measures which had been adopted since 1842 had
totally changed the current of public opinion, and it
was now only the shipowners, and the still powerful
Protectionist party in Parliament, which resisted this
last crowning measure of Free-trade. The opposition
of the shipowners arose from a deep-seated conviction
that utter and inevitable ruin to their class would
result from the abrogation of the Navigation Laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of
1849.</div>

<p>Parliament assembled on the 2nd of February,
1849. The commercial and manufacturing interests
were rallying, but had not as yet effectually revived
from the prostration occasioned by the commercial
crisis of 1847, and the general want of confidence
resulting from the shock of the foreign revolutions in
1848. The shipping trade was in a state of transition,
as it was not until some time later that the gold
discoveries in Australia gave a fresh impulse to the
“long voyage” trade, and that towards a region of
the globe which promised but a slow, however certain,
future development of wealth and navigation.
The shipowners were, in fact, still suffering a periodical
depression of trade after two or three very
prosperous years.</p>

<p>In the Speech from the Throne delivered by her
Majesty in person, she said: “I again commend to
your attention the restrictions imposed on commerce
by the Navigation Laws. If you shall find that
these laws are, in whole or in part, unnecessary for
the maintenance of our maritime power while they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
fetter trade and industry, you will no doubt deem it
right to repeal or modify their provisions.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Lord
George
Bentinck,
21st September,
1848.</div>

<p>When the House of Commons assembled, a great
void was felt in the absence of Lord George Bentinck,
who, during the recess, had been snatched away
by death in the very pride of manhood. His devotion
to the cause of the shipowners and Protectionist
principles rendered his loss deeply felt by many
classes. On the day of his interment, which was
dark, cold, and drizzling, this feeling of respect was
paid in a manner almost reverential. From nine till
eleven o’clock that day all the British shipping in
the docks and in the river, from London Bridge to
Gravesend, hoisted flags half-mast high, and minute
guns were fired from appointed stations along the
Thames. The same mournful ceremony was observed
in all the ports of the United Kingdom; and not
only in these, for the flag was half-mast high on every
British ship at Antwerp, Rotterdam, and Havre.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
Whatever may have been the political errors of Lord
George Bentinck, he was eminently the friend and
champion of the shipowners. Shortly before his
death he had renounced the leadership of his party
in the House of Commons, and Mr. Disraeli had succeeded
him. In the House of Lords the re-appointment
of the committee of the preceding year was
slightly mentioned; but upon an intimation from the
Marquess of Lansdowne that the measure to be introduced
by Government would not be delayed for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>report of this committee, the shipowners abandoned
whatever designs some of them may have had to
prolong the inquiry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Labouchere’s
new resolution,
February
14, 1849.</div>

<p>On the 14th February Mr. Labouchere, still President
of the Board of Trade, moved a fresh resolution
almost in the identical terms employed in the preceding
year. He recapitulated at great length the
arguments in favour of repeal which he had employed
in the previous session. It will be unnecessary to
dwell upon these here; but his new light with regard
to the coasting trade deserves a place in tracing the
progress of our mercantile marine: on this branch of
the subject he seemed to tremble before the superior
abilities of Mr. Gladstone; and the remarks of that
gentleman intimating a strong desire to surrender
the coasting trade, with a view to obtain in return
that of the United States, evidently made considerable
impression upon his mind, so that he scarcely
knew what to grant or refuse. Mr. Gladstone asked,
not merely that we should give colonial trade for
colonial trade, but our coasting trade for theirs. It
was asserted that the American trade, say from New
York to California, was a foreign, or colonial, rather
than a coasting traffic. But to argue that a voyage
from London to Malta was to be held part of a colonial
trade, while a voyage from California to New
York was to be considered part of a coasting trade,
was preposterous, and Mr. Labouchere affected to
believe that the United States would not persist in
a policy so contrary to the dictates of justice and
common sense.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Proposed
change in
the coasting
trade.</div>

<p>The fresh consideration which Mr. Labouchere had
given to his measure enabled him now to propose a
plan which, while it did not imply a total abolition
of all restrictions, would effect a considerable modification
of them, and at the same time enable us, as
he conceived, to get, <i>without cavil or hesitation</i>, such
a measure from America as the important interests
of this country demanded, without exposing our
revenue to danger, or exciting alarm among those
engaged in the coasting trade of this country.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Such were the sanguine but vain expectations of
Mr. Labouchere. He tried to make it appear that
there were two branches of the coasting trade,
which, although they went by the same name, were
yet essentially distinct from each other. There
was the trade, conducted principally either by steamboats
or small vessels, consisting in the carrying of
goods and passengers to and fro, and depending on
local connection with the places between which the
trade was conducted. With that trade foreigners
could not compete; and, consequently, he illogically
argued that it was not intended to disturb that trade
or throw it open to foreign competition; so that he
proposed to keep the coasting trade, which consisted
of passing from one port to another of the United
Kingdom, on its present footing. Government had,
however, he said, resolved to abolish restrictions
which prevented the combination of a coasting with
a foreign voyage. It was not proposed that either a
foreign vessel or an English vessel foreign bound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>should be allowed to proceed from port to port in
England and then return; but that sailing from a
British port, and being bound for a foreign port,
they should be permitted to carry from one British
port to another, and then clear out and proceed on
their voyage. The Customs’ authorities reported
that this could be done consistently with safety to
the revenue, provided there was a restriction that the
cargoes should not be carried in vessels under 100
tons burden, so as to prevent smuggling, although,
as a matter of fact, the light dues and other charges
must effectually prevent such a trade. Such was
the bungling scheme respecting the coasting trade
proposed by Mr. Labouchere, whereby he attempted

terms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Bancroft
recalcitrates.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Hence
withdrawal
of the
coasting
clauses.</div>

<p>When Alderman Thompson asked whether any
intimation had been received from the American
Government as to any convention with respect to the
coasting trade, Mr. Labouchere answered, that in a
recent interview he had had with Mr. Bancroft, that
gentleman said, “he should be willing the next day
to sign any convention which should include the
coasting trade”, and Mr. Labouchere believed him to
be sincere;<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> though, by Mr. Buchanan’s letter of the
9th February (which had not yet reached England),
the American Secretary of State had expressly said,
“<i>the coasting trade is of course reserved</i>.” As a matter
of course, when Mr. Buchanan’s letter reached England
all Mr. Labouchere’s visions of reciprocity in
the coasting trade vanished. At a subsequent period
Mr. Labouchere, curiously enough, entered into a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>defence of Mr. Bancroft, “who was a most honourable
and straightforward man.” Be that, however,
as it may, he certainly deceived Mr. Labouchere;
and, indeed, Lord Palmerston also, who up to the 5th
March, expressed himself in the strongest manner
that the reply of the American Government would
fully bear out Mr. Bancroft’s pledges. Such was the
ignominious rejection of these clauses relating to the
coasting trade, which had been inserted in the Bill
of 1849 to meet “the conciliatory disposition” of
Mr. Bancroft, but which his superiors at Washington
sternly and unequivocally repudiated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The debate.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Alderman
Thompson,
&amp;c.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mr.
Ricardo.</div>

<p>The debate on Mr. Labouchere’s resolution brought
out again all Mr. Herries’ arguments and adverse
predictions about repeal. Alderman Thompson complained
that the United States minister was recalled
with every change of Presidency, and that Mr. Bancroft
was notoriously more liberal than President
Taylor, who had been elected upon the principle of
Protection to native industry. Mr. Banks, Mr. Hildyard,
Sir John Tyrrell, and the Marquess of Granby
followed Mr. Herries and Alderman Thompson in
the same line of objection; whilst Mr. Hume, Colonel
Thompson, Mr. Mitchell, and Mr. John Williams,
maintained the Free-trade line of argument. Mr. J. L.
Ricardo vehemently supported the extreme views of
Free-trade, and said emphatically to the shipowners:
“Depend upon yourselves—depend upon your energies
as Englishmen—depend upon the resources of
this country and the wealth which commands the
resources of the world, and do not trust to Acts of
Parliament. It would be better to send forth our
ships free as the winds which filled their sails, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
liberty to go where they would, and come from where
it suited them, than to start them from our ports
encumbered with the 8 &amp; 9 Vict. cap. 88, and ballasted
with twelve volumes of Hertslet’s ‘Commercial
Treaties.’” The resolution was agreed to without
a trial of strength, and the Bill was brought in.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
It contained twenty-three clauses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meeting
of the
Shipowners’
Society.</div>

<p>Upon the 2nd March, the second reading of the
Bill having been fixed for the 9th March, the General
Shipowners’ Society held their annual meeting at
the London Tavern. Their accustomed comments
upon lights, harbours, and pilotage; discriminating
duties in foreign ports; the East Indian salt monopoly;
the Merchant Seamen’s Act; the Passengers’
Act; the Merchant Seamen’s Fund, and a variety of
other points, which, at ordinary times, usually occupied
a large share of their attention and space in
their report—were on this occasion all subordinate
to the one question of all-absorbing consequence, the
threatened impending repeal of the Navigation Laws.
To discuss special regulations affecting maritime
commerce, while the whole question of general policy
trembled in the balance, was both inconvenient and
embarrassing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their report.</div>

<p>The committee narrated at great length the various
steps taken by Government since 1846 with regard
to the Navigation Laws. In reviewing the evidence
taken before both Houses, the shipowners made it
appear that they were completely triumphant in
establishing all the various points on which they took
their ground; viz., that no evil susceptible of any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>remedy had been or could be proved, arising from
the practical operation of the Navigation Laws: that
the maintenance of the Protective principle on
which those laws were founded was indispensable to
the maintenance of an extensive mercantile marine:
that the preservation of such a mercantile marine
was equally necessary for the existence of a powerful
navy: and that, hence, the repeal of the Navigation
Laws would involve danger to the basis of our
national defence.</p>

<p>Having proclaimed their own triumph, they next
turned their attention to the Bill then before the
public, and, pointing out the unsparing criticism it
had provoked, demanded the strenuous and uncompromising
resistance, not only of every shipowner,
but of every friend to his country. They accordingly
denounced it “as fraught with consequences
destructive to the shipping interest, and dangerous to
the welfare and safety of the country;” in short, as
one of the most unjust measures ever submitted to
Parliament.</p>

<p>The Committee next proceeded to analyse the Bill,
justifying their censure of its provisions. It was said
to be a concession to the demands of the West Indies
and Canada. The demand having been made under
an official stimulant, the West Indian interest, perceiving
their error, they alleged, has now disclaimed
it, and publicly declared that they have no desire
for the repeal. Canada, with selfish and precipitate
incaution, had put forward a similar demand; but
the demand for free navigation was coupled in the
same document with an inconsistent claim for the
re-enactment of a Protective duty in favour of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
agricultural produce. The expectation of benefit
entertained by the Canadians from the repeal of the
Navigation Laws had, in the opinion of the shipowners,
as little real foundation as those the West
Indians had first entertained, but subsequently abandoned.
Their Committee expressed doubt of any
beneficial reciprocity from the United States, especially
as any commercial treaty must be controlled
by two-thirds of the Senate.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> They treated the
power of re-imposing restrictions as in principle
opposed to every prudent rule of State policy. The
coasting-trade clauses, of course, met with condemnation.
If, they asserted, the censure cast upon shipmasters
was deserved, the injustice to the owner was
flagrant. If unmerited, the measure was sustained
by cruel calumny.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The manning-clause
grievance.</div>

<p>But the most notorious as well as the most important
and disqualifying inconsistency was the
compulsion on a British shipowner to man his ship
with British seamen. This was magnified into a
stupendous grievance. It was said to force the shipowner
to conduct his affairs contrary to his conviction
of his own interest, and according to the
arbitrary dictates of an inconsistent and tyrannical
Act of Parliament. The Committee, kindling with
indignation at the mere recital of their grievances,
averred that if the Navigation Laws were repealed,
a British registry must be regarded as a badge of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>slavery, and an instrument of oppressive interference;
nor did they doubt that to escape its bonds, unaccompanied
as it then would be by any benefit whatsoever,
British capital would to a great extent be invested in
foreign shipping, to be engaged in the British carrying
trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Policy proposed.</div>

<p>With these views, they enjoined union among
themselves. They trusted that shipowners would
abstain from promulgating separate opinions, or
allow themselves to be drawn into controversy and
disunion, as, by these means, successful resistance
would be impossible. They called on the shipowners
at the several outports to send deputies to the
“central committee in London for upholding the
principles of the Navigation Laws.”</p>

<p>By these means, they argued that there would be
an opportunity for a careful consideration of the
future steps to be taken during the progress of the
Bill through the House of Commons. They further
suggested, that every possible endeavour should be
made to enlist the sympathy and engage the support
of other powerful interests. The principle they
proposed was the disclaiming all desire for monopoly,
and the advocacy of such moderate and just protection
to all interests as would admit of foreign
competition, so far as might be sufficient to stimulate
to the utmost domestic energies, but, at the same
time, would limit this competition within such bounds
as to prevent domestic energies from being crushed
in the struggle. They concluded by reminding the
shipowners that “Union is Strength,” and by expressing
a fervent hope that this contest, which their
enemies had insultingly designated as a struggle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
“for the last rag of Protection,” would, in its results,
roll back the tide on their opponents, thus leading
to the universal application of the principles of
just and moderate protection to domestic interests,
and superseding for ever the rash and delusive
theories which, in recent legislation, had successively
involved every interest of the State in difficulty, distress,
and ruin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Agitation
in the
country.</div>

<p>The agitation thus invoked by the central body of
shipowners in London was responded to by their
fellow-shipowners throughout the country. Meetings
were held at Belfast, Bristol, Dartmouth, Devonport,
Dunfermline, Dundee, Exeter, Exmouth, Fleetwood,
Glasgow, Gateshead, Hull, Hartlepool, London,
Liverpool, Leith, Lynn, Montrose, Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
Portsmouth, Penzance, Perth, Sunderland,
Shields, St. Andrews, Swansea, Saltash, Tynemouth,
Weymouth, and Yarmouth. The petition
from London was signed by 27,000 persons of the
most respectable classes; while that from Liverpool
comprised 24,700 names, not shipowners exclusively.
This petition, eloquently drawn up, expressed
alarm at the progress of a measure which proposed
to take away from this country advantages it had
so long and so successfully enjoyed, and to invite,
unwisely, foreign nations to share those advantages
with us; nations, too, utterly unable, even if willing,
to confer on us any adequate equivalent in return.
It pointed at the evident result of the substitution, to
a great extent, of foreign for British and colonial
shipping, the employment of foreign labour and
capital in lieu of our own, and the creation of new relations
between foreign nations and our own colonies;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
thereby weakening the ties which bind the latter to
the mother-country, and diminishing British power
and influence throughout the world. They did not
fail to show, above all, the consequences the measure
would have on the supply of seamen to the Royal
Navy.</p>

<p>The second reading of the Bill was fixed for the
9th March, when each party mustered all its
forces. The shipowners throughout the kingdom
were in a state of great excitement. It was true that
among them were many who were ready to accept
the measure as proposed by Government, if other
nations would only reciprocate; and there were even
a few who were so extreme in their views of Free-trade
as to desire that the Bill should be carried
as it stood, but the majority were vehemently
opposed to repeal; and, though some fears were
entertained that the second reading of the Bill would
be carried in the House of Commons, it was confidently
anticipated that a considerable majority in
the Lords would, under the brilliant leadership of
Lord Stanley (Lord Derby), who had warmly
espoused their cause, defeat its progress and throw
out the Whig administration.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_97" href="#FNanchor_97" class="label">[97]</a> It was on this occasion that I first appeared before the public as a
politician. Following in the wake, but a long way astern, of Sir Robert
Peel and Mr. Gladstone, I addressed a number of letters to Lord John
Russell, which appeared in the ‘Morning Herald,’ and were afterwards
republished in a pamphlet. They had a very large circulation, and
caused considerable excitement among shipowners at the time. They
were written in a homely style, commencing, “I am a plain man of
business, daily to be found at my office in one of the City lanes, in the
midst of my clerks, in the centre of a large dingy room. Business is my
politics, not politics my business. If I have a leaning it is towards
Free-trade principles,” and so forth. But I soon learned that my
“principles,” as I laid them down, were, however plausible, fundamentally
and radically wrong. Sound enough they no doubt were, <i>if
all nations had been prepared to adopt them</i>; and if they could have been
applied to the world at large, no system could have been more perfect.
But, unfortunately, Foreign States were not prepared to adopt Free-trade;
and if we adopted retaliation against those which did not, we
reverted to Protection in its most pernicious form. Consequently we
pursued the policy most likely to suit our own interests, and very
wisely did not attempt to enforce it on other nations. Therein Government
was right and I was wrong.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_100" href="#FNanchor_100" class="label">[100]</a> In truth, the policy of the American Government, since that
country became an independent nation, has with few exceptions been
throughout in favour of Protection. When Congress was first inaugurated
in 1789, one of the measures of that year (4th July) was
“An Act for levying Duty on Goods,” &amp;c., and another (20th July,
1789) was passed, entitled “An Act imposing Duties on Tonnage.”
Indeed, so thoroughly Protectionist were the great founders of the
Republic, that Mr. Adams, writing to Mr. Jay in Paris on the 26th
February, 1786, says: “If the United States would come to the resolution
to prevent all foreign vessels from coming to their ports, and
confine all exports and imports to their own ships and seamen, <i>they
would do for anything that I know the wisest thing which human prudence
could dictate</i>.” Further he says: “On the other hand, if the United
States would adopt the principle of the French economists, and allow
the ships and merchants of all nations equal privileges with their own
citizens, the consequence would be the sudden annihilation of their
manufactures and navigation.” And this has been in a great measure
the opinion entertained by the Americans throughout, no doubt
under the impression that, with so vast a territory, where they had
within themselves almost everything they required, they could do
without foreign nations. They have not yet seen the advantages they
would derive by being allowed to purchase in the cheapest market,
wherever that market may be,—home or abroad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Debate,
March
1849.</div>

<p>The House of Commons, though seldom much interested
in maritime and, as was conceived, in intricate
questions, was, on this occasion, full to the overflowing.
The subject was, indeed, one of crowning
interest. The repeal of the Navigation Laws would,
as the extreme Free-traders had remarked, sweep
away “the last rag of Protection;” as others
more pompously had expressed it, would form the
“capital of that majestic column of unfettered commerce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
which their own hands had reared.” The Protectionists,
on the other hand, looked on the measure
as the final overthrow of our naval power and the destruction
of our maritime commerce. The shipowners
mustered in great numbers about the Commons;
and the author, who had not, at that time, found a
seat in the body of the House, was favoured with
one in the reporters’ gallery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Speech of
Mr. Herries.</div>

<p>Mr. Herries was once more selected as the champion
of the shipping interest; and, on the question
being put that “this Bill be <i>now</i> read a second time,”
moved an amendment that it “be read a second time
that day six months.” If Mr. Herries was not gifted
with great eloquence, he possessed at least great experience,
and a thorough knowledge of his subject.
His speech in opposition to the Bill was of the most
elaborate character. He insisted, that the more the
measure was examined, the more the shipowners and
the public were adverse to its passing. He examined
at great length the correspondence from our colonies
and from Foreign Powers, contending that that from
Canada was useless, if not repugnant. In point
of fact, he said, taking his text from the report of
the Shipowners’ Society, the opinion of the Canadians
had changed, and the public sentiment there
appeared decidedly adverse to repeal. A similar
change of feeling seemed to have come over the West
India colonists, and they had shifted their ground.
Germany would do nothing until the central German
government was appointed, which, in his opinion,
would probably be about the Greek Kalends! The
United States pointed out the existing law, but could
not answer us till Congress had been consulted. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
replies from other nations were gone over <i>seriatim</i>,
and the conduct of Belgium in adhering to what was
thought best for Belgian interests was applauded as
a wise and liberal course. No foreign Government
had given a distinct answer except Belgium, and that
was not a favourable one. We had abandoned, he said,
some of our restrictive laws in relation to European
navigation, and wisely abandoned them, because we
could not maintain them any longer. That was the
ground of Mr. Huskisson’s modifications: but we
ought, at present, to hold what we could, and to concede
only what we must, in matters of navigation.
He admitted, amidst the derisive cheers of the repeal
party, that the Navigation Laws imposed restraints
on commerce, and so far operated unfavourably; but
the question to be considered was whether the gain
to be derived from the abolition of these laws was a
sufficient inducement for running the risk of the loss
to which this abolition must lead. All prudence and
sound judgment was opposed to repeal. The voice
now rising from every quarter would soon reach
those in whose hands the government was placed,
and they would learn that their first duty was to
uphold British interests, maintain British commerce,
and promote British enterprise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. J.
Wilson.</div>

<p>Mr. James Wilson, who replied at great length to
Mr. Herries, had a few years previously started a
Free-trade journal, the ‘Economist,’ and, having
obtained a seat in the House of Commons, became a
staunch and formidable advocate of an extreme Free-trade
policy. He was a master in statistics, and, as
figures were the rage at the time, he happily seized
the moment which led to a political fortune, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
using his knowledge of them to the best advantage
became a valuable adjunct to the ministry of the day.
His speech on the present occasion showed the beneficial
action of Free-trade in the removal of needless
restrictions, and, further, that, though our merchants
had been exposed to great competition, the aggregate
commerce of the country had been proportionally
augmented; he therefore asked why the shipping
interest should be exempted from a rivalry which
other interests had successfully encountered. He then
demonstrated the little real advantage the Navigation
Laws gave to British shipowners, who, by the
very policy of those laws, were exposed to competition
in the long-voyage trade in the very places where competition
was most injurious to them; and, further, that
all the tests fairly applied to the question proved the
ability of British shipowners to compete with the
foreigner. In some cases, too, he held that the Navigation
Laws acted as a protection to foreign at the
expense of British ships; and while, practically, of
little benefit to the shipowner, there could be no
doubt that these restrictions operated injuriously,
especially in emergencies, on consumers, and, ultimately
of course, on shipowners themselves. If a
commercial marine was necessary to support our
navy, Free-trade had increased and would increase
that marine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Question
of reciprocity.</div>

<p>But perhaps the most important part of Mr.
Wilson’s speech was that relating to the question of
reciprocity. The general question was, indeed, beginning
to resolve itself into three points. All
parties had come to the conclusion that some change
was necessary; but it remained to be decided whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
reciprocity, conditional legislation and retaliation,
should be the principle of the measure. Mr. Gladstone
last year had strongly urged the principle of
reciprocity in some cases by special treaties. Mr.
Wilson very strongly combated this principle. Nothing
he thought would be more prejudicial to the
spread of Free-trade principles among continental
nations than that this country should sanction the
notion entertained by foreign Governments, that
the British Government was willing to make concessions
not so much for the general benefit of
commerce, as for the sake of other concessions, to
be thus obtained from foreign countries in favour
of England. Foreign nations considered England
as an old and wealthy nation, and expected to be
overreached in forming commercial treaties.</p>

<p>He objected, therefore, to the principle of reciprocity,
as it would actually throw difficulties in the way
of those who were willing to meet us. On any principle
of reciprocity they must adopt that of equivalents,
and this was impossible. Other countries had
no colonies, and had, consequently, no equivalent
advantages to offer in return for those conferred by
England. He admitted, however, that there was a
great distinction between reciprocity in produce and
reciprocity in shipping. If they imposed retaliatory
duties on the produce of various countries, for the
purpose of meeting duties imposed on their own
goods, they did not visit the same interests with this
retaliation. For example, cotton and woollen goods
were sent to Prussia: we received from Prussia, corn,
timber, and wool. If Prussia imposed high duties on
cotton and woollen goods, we could only retaliate by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
putting high duties on the corn, timber, and wool of
Prussia when imported into England. The Prussian
Government punished the woollen manufacturer and
the cotton manufacturer of England by imposing
high duties on their goods; and, then, the English
Legislature punished them again by imposing high
duties on the raw material from which those goods
were manufactured. Nothing could be more monstrous
than such a course of proceeding. If we acted
on the principle of reciprocity, we ought to give
perfect freedom of trade to those who gave perfect
freedom of trade to us. If the United States admitted
our goods duty free, we could not do less
than admit the corn of the United States free.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doubtful
even in
the case of
shipping.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty
of the “Favoured-nation”
clause.</div>

<p>Suppose, again, Russia, on the Black Sea, imposed
a duty of 50 per cent. on manufactures, we
must retaliate by a duty of 50 per cent. on Russian
corn and timber. We must, in fact, have distinct
treaties and distinct tariffs, and there would
hence result a most complicated system of international
commerce. Reciprocity meant that or nothing.
But, after thus stating his views on reciprocity
of produce, Mr. Wilson admitted that by imposing
restrictions on foreign ships corresponding
with those imposed on our own, we should have
the advantage of dealing with the same interest, and
the weapon would be more likely to be effectual, in
that those, for whose sake duties were imposed abroad,
would be subject to corresponding disadvantages in
this country. But he was wholly opposed to reciprocity
even in shipping. He had shown what variety
of treaties would be required if the principle of reciprocity
was adopted with regard to manufactures and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
produce; and he felt convinced that a corresponding
or analogous difficulty would arise from adopting
that principle in the case of shipping. Very intricate
and complicated regulations would be required.
Thus, supposing we found a country disposed to
give all, we ourselves would be obliged to give
all. But then it must be borne in mind that there
were twenty countries with whom we had already
treaties, and to whom we were bound to extend the
advantages obtainable by the most favoured nations:
and, therefore, if, now, we gave privileges to any one
country, we must extend the same to all the other
countries which stood in the same position.</p>

<p>Suppose, he said, that Hamburg were to give this
country all that it required, and that, in return, its
ships were placed on the same footing as British ships;
what guarantee should we have that a third country,
which had given us nothing, would not derive the
same advantages as the shipowners of Hamburg, or
that the sugar of Java, and the coffee of South America,
would not be brought to this country in their
ships? There would be no end of evasion. The
United States would reciprocate; Prussia would do the
same; Russia and the ports of the Hanseatic League
would follow their example: what, therefore, had this
country to fear? It was admitted that we should not
expect the same reciprocity from France, Spain, or
Belgium; but, in these cases, should we be really
worse off than we are now? At this moment France
and Spain had great privileges in this country.
France had the right, not according to treaty, but
from the general policy of our Navigation Laws, to
send her produce direct to this country in her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
ships. She, however, availed herself to a very small
extent of this privilege. Nine-tenths of the importations
of Spanish colonial sugars came likewise in
British bottoms. As far as regards the reservations
at the discretion of the Queen in Council, Free-trade
unrestricted would most assuredly be the rule and
restriction the exception.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marquess
of Granby.</div>

<p>The Marquess of Granby followed on the side of
Protection, urging the mischief that would result
from the great number of persons thrown out of employment;
he pointed out how uncertain were the
advantages to be derived, and the reality of its evils;
but despite of disadvantages, if Englishmen were but
true to themselves and their country, he felt that
we should be able to weather the impending storm,
and retain the command of that “glorious element”
which was our natural protector, so that the flag
of England might still for years to come “wave
triumphant over every sea.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Cardwell.</div>

<p>Mr. Cardwell, although he could not share in the
gloomy apprehensions of Mr. Herries or the eloquent
doubts of the Marquess of Granby, felt the
importance of this question and its bearing on the
mercantile interests of England and her colonies.
He warned the House of the danger of not taking
timely steps with regard to what was called the
“long-voyage” clause, which some of the witnesses
before the Lords’ Committee regarded as a fundamental
principle of the Navigation Laws; and he
showed that the effect of maintaining this clause
would be to defeat the policy of the warehousing
system, and rob us of a large share of the commerce
of the world. There was nothing more important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
than that great interest known by the denomination
of the “warehousing system,” which had been the
growth of comparatively recent years and was the
offspring of a judicious relaxation in the Navigation
Laws: this system he held had made this country
the entrepôt between regions furnishing tropical produce
and the great consuming countries of Europe.
Mr. Cardwell then urged the importance of the
Canadian claims, and described the keen competition
going on between Canada and the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Henley</div>

<p>Mr. Henley went into a long argument against
the Bill, especially animadverting upon Mr. Wilson’s
having derided reciprocity, while nevertheless the
Bill legislated for it, and Government had been in
correspondence with foreign Governments for the
purpose of securing it. “What did the Government
intend to do,” he asked, “on the subject of impressment?
If the masters were to be taken from a
superior class, were they still liable to be impressed?”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
The experiment of Free-trade had not in Mr. Henley’s
opinion been sufficiently tried to justify the application
of that principle to another great interest. If
the country were polled, every man, he was sure,
would cheerfully pay the hardly-appreciable advance
in prices, rather than run the risk of a failure in an
experiment so dangerous. No one had attempted to
deny that obstruction was here, and inconvenience
there; but when you came to balance the possible
risk with the possible gain, no one would be disposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>to run that risk, which he for one feared must take
place if the measure were carried. It was a great
interest to tamper with, and involved not only
capital and industry, but the national defences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Gladstone.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Burdens
to be removed
from Shipowners.</div>

<p>The debate was adjourned to the 13th of March,
when it was resumed by Mr. Gladstone, with his
usual ability, in an elaborate speech. He supported
the second reading of the Bill, as furnishing the only
opportunity of inducing the House to agree to a
change in the Navigation Laws. He denied that this
change would be the destruction of the shipping interests,
and thought it was a fitting time for effecting
numerous alterations. Mr. Gladstone, however, differed
from many who supported the measure. His
doctrine was still that they should not abandon the
path of experience. In his opinion, it was only on
principles analogous to those of Mr. Huskisson that
we could safely depart from the system of navigation
we had so long pursued, interwoven as this had
been, for centuries, with our national policy. There
were several demands the shipowner might fairly
make upon the Legislature when about to be deprived
of protection. He was entitled to the removal of
every peculiar burden by which he was now hampered.
If we exposed him to unrestricted competition
with foreigners, we should give him a drawback,
or a remission of the duties on the timber he required
for the construction of his ships. He should also be
relieved from the restraint with respect to the manning
of his ships. There was another compensation
to which the shipowner was entitled. By repealing
the Navigation Laws, he would have to undergo competition
from the Baltic, sharp as far as it went, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
from the United States, all over the world. He was
therefore entitled to ask that he should be admitted
to those fields of employment from which he was then
excluded. The policy pointed out by experience, Mr.
Gladstone contended, was that of <i>conditional</i> relaxation.
He had never entertained the notion that we
should proceed by treaties of reciprocity with foreign
Powers. There were difficulties in the way of doing
so which a wise Legislature would avoid. The American
system, so far as it went, should be our model.
By adopting it, he considered that difficulties inseparable
from the system of reciprocity treaties would be
avoided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conditional
legislation
recommended.</div>

<p>The immediate effect of conditional relaxation
would be to give vessels of such States as conferred
privileges on our shipping corresponding advantages
in our ports. Such a course would be in accordance
with precedent and experience; was demanded by justice,
and would be found easier of execution than the
plan proposed by the Queen’s Government. There
was in his mind an insuperable objection to any form
of retaliation. Every word urged against the system of
reciprocity told with augmented force against that
of retaliation. He would join in opposing that feature
of the plan, regarding it, as he did, as a material defect.
But if Government would not consent to legislate on
the subject, conditionally, he would advise it to do so
directly, without the accompaniment of retaliation.
In fact, the conditional system was that on which
we now, practically, acted with regard to many of the
maritime nations of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Americans

<div class="sidenote">Smuggling

<p>There was another feature in the Government
proposition Mr. Gladstone regarded as defective.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
He was of opinion that the mode in which it proposed
to deal with the coasting trade would be found
ineffectual. Before we could expect to get the advantage
of the American coasting trade we must
throw our own unreservedly open to that country.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
Any chance we could have of getting from America
a share of her coasting trade must depend upon our
offering her our entire coasting trade, leaving her
perfectly free to accept it or not, under the regulations
now affecting British ships engaged in it. But
we must not expect of America that she would fetter
herself towards other countries by those particular
regulations which it was proposed to lay down, and
which do not give up the whole coasting trade, but
only portions of it; to any such regulations we could
not expect that America would agree. “If we proceed
by <i>un</i>conditional legislation, and offer up our colonial
trade instead of giving up our coasting trade, I believe
she will get our colonial trade, and may then
be ready to give up some comparatively insignificant
advantages in return; <i>but America is not a lover of
Free-trade in the abstract</i>. The Protectionist principle
is very strong in America,” he continued, “although
it is not so strong with reference to shipping as to
manufactures.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> For these and other reasons Mr.
Gladstone insisted on the expediency of throwing open
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>the coasting trade to the foreigner, “if he could find
his way into it.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> At present the uniform and invariable
rule, he added, is to insist on the strictest
possible separation between the outward and inward-bound
goods, between foreign trade goods and goods
coastwise; and, in point of fact, with a system of
drawbacks and high duty goods, there would be the
greatest danger to the revenue, or we must undergo
the most enormous expense, if we do not insist on
the separation of cargoes. But if a vessel is allowed
to take in goods to carry coastwise, duty paid, she
might be taking in tobacco in Liverpool, duty paid,
to carry it coastwise, while at the same time she was
discharging tobacco at Liverpool, not duty paid. This
would be fraught with great danger. Mr. Gladstone
then pointed out the conflicting interests of various
colonies; and that the only way to render justice to
all was by conditional legislation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Robinson.</div>

<p>The substance of the speech of Mr. Robinson,
Chairman of Lloyd’s, who followed Mr. Gladstone,
was, in the event of the Bill passing, to claim indemnity
for the shipowner. Would Government, he
asked, take the duty off timber; the duty on the
timber for a vessel of 200 tons being 300<i>l.</i>? There
was also the duty on marine <i>assurances</i>; and, indeed,
all the taxes now pressing on the British shipowner,
but from which the foreigner was free. Would
Government relieve the shipowner from the apprenticeship
restrictions, and allow him to man his ship
with foreign seamen? Government, he felt sure, could
not give any such assurance, and if they did and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>promise was realised, Mr. Robinson doubted if, even
then, the British shipowner could compete successfully
with the foreigner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Clay.</div>

<p>Mr. Clay, the extreme Liberal member for Hull,
who would perhaps have lost his seat had he voted
for repeal, made a Free-trade speech, but ended by
voting against the Government measure. The position
he took was that as long as the burdens of the
shipowner remained, protection must be conceded to
him. Mr. Hornby, who represented another of the
outports, recommended that concessions should only
be made <i>pari passu</i>, and that we ought not to give up
the all-important maritime advantages we possess.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. T. A.
Mitchell.</div>

<p>Mr. T. A. Mitchell reproached Free-traders like
Mr. Hornby for voting against repeal, and especially
animadverted on Mr. Gladstone’s procedure, whose
speech in its general effect was surprising, as coming
from an advocate of Free-trade. A more effectual
mode, in his judgment, could not have been taken to
damage the whole scheme. Mr. Mitchell ardently
supported repeal, not believing the average rate of
freights would decline in consequence; moreover, the
repeal, he thought, would enable us to escape the inordinately
high freights which, in times of sudden
emergency we were now called upon to pay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Hildyard.</div>

<p>Mr. Hildyard urged very strongly the importance
of the coasting trade of the United States, and the
necessity of securing it. He admitted that the coast
of England was a difficult and dangerous one, and
that there was not much chance of America competing
with us in that trade. On the other hand, the
coasting trade of America was of great importance.
An United States committee on harbours and rivers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
during the preceding year, had shown that no fewer
than eight States were mainly dependent upon seven
great lakes for their commercial intercourse; and
that the line of coast of these eight States was not
less than 3000 miles; while, on the Mississippi and
its tributaries, fourteen States in 1846, with a population
of 6,500,000, relied for their easiest means
of intercommunication. The sea-board of Maine
was more valuable still; so that it was of very
great importance, if concessions were to be made,
that we should participate in the coasting trade of
America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr.
Ricardo.</div>

<p>Mr. Ricardo, while supporting the propriety of
freeing the shipowners from many of the burdens
imposed on them, argued that the retaliatory clause
could not possibly be maintained, and that the proposed
reciprocity system was equally untenable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. H.
Drummond.</div>

<p>Mr. H. Drummond, in one of his witty, splenetic
speeches, opposed the Bill. The object, he said, of
every statesman in past times had been to prevent
capital from going out of the country, on the ground
that, if capital went out of the country, the labour of
the country would not be employed. Now every
successive minister had to get up, and, on every question
brought forward, to go against every principle he
had previously defended, and so to take the opposite
side of every view he had before maintained. There
were Fates presiding from which no minister could
liberate himself; while, as for the House itself, there
would appear to be a spell over them, rendering
them passive and helpless; while every successive
Chancellor of the Exchequer picked away at their
livers <i>ad libitum</i>. The most celebrated statesman of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
antiquity said: “There is in maritime States a corruption
and instability of morals, for they import
not only merchandise but morals, so that nothing can
remain entire in the institutions of their country.”
The only quarrel, Mr. Drummond added, he had with
the Free-traders was with respect to Adam Smith,
that they never would read beyond one page of him.
And yet, it was by men actuated by similarly interested
motives, that the House was now guided.
The manufacturer sent out to Africa for cotton; he
employed African labourers in its cultivation; he
brought it home in an American ship; he spun it
into yarn by his machinery, and then sent it in a
French vessel to be exchanged for French cloth or
silks, or other articles of French manufacture. So
that the whole process might be perfected without
the employment of a single English labourer. The
poet exclaimed:—</p>

<p>Yes! at Manchester there were a thousand such.
Not content with bringing accusations against the
English sailors, not content with slighting the
opinions of their officers, they now said this country
had a superstitious reverence for the navy. He would
not deny that they might have had such a feeling,
for there was a time when they had a national faith;
there was a time when they venerated, worshipped
even, the statesman who guided safely the destinies
of the country; when they reverenced the magistrates
who presided over the administration of their laws;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
when they gloried in the soldiers and the sailors who
maintained the greatness of the nation throughout
the world; when the noblest <i>credo</i> that they had was
“Rule Britannia!” and when the finest anthem in
their ritual was “God save the Queen!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Labouchere’s
reply.</div>

<p>After this protracted debate, Mr. Labouchere rose
to reply. He went over the chief points urged
against repeal, and asked for no vote in favour of it
but from those who admitted the propriety of a departure
from the system of the Navigation Laws.
He was ready to consider any suggestions, in reference
to the details, provided they were not inconsistent
with the principle of the Bill. He saw no
reason why the <i>present</i> retention of the timber duties
should operate as a bar to the immediate repeal of
the Navigation Laws. He opposed Mr. Gladstone’s
views as narrow and erroneous, and contrary to the
true policy of the country. Our commercial policy
should not be made to depend upon the views and
caprices of foreign States.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the opinion of the
House in favour of an extensive change in the Navigation
Laws was carried in a House of only 411 members
by a majority of 117 members. Now, after a
year’s reflection, we find that in a House of 476 members,
the majority of 117 had dwindled down to 56!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
This great diminution of the apparent power of Free-traders
resulted partly from a general depression of
the shipping interests, but, principally, from the great
exertions the Shipowners were making to agitate
the country in their favour. The announcement of
the diminished majority was hailed by the opponents
of the measure with loud and prolonged cheering.
Every vote was scanned with the most hostile criticism,
and Mr. Cardwell, the newly-elected member
for Liverpool, was especially censured for voting
against the interests of that great maritime port.
The Shipowners now took fresh courage, and issued
fresh denunciations against the measure, and against
the whole of the Free-trade journals—ministerial,
Peel, and Cobdenite—which had joined in full cry
for the repeal of the Navigation Laws. The agitation
against repeal was renewed with fresh vigour
on the part of the Shipowners’ Society. It was now
fondly hoped that, by agitation, the majority in the
House of Commons would diminish in future stages
of the Bill, in which case there could be no doubt
that the House of Lords would throw it out, and perhaps
compel the resignation of Ministers.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Committee

<div class="sidenote">Coasting
clauses
withdrawn.</div>

<p>On the 23rd March, the motion for going into
Committee on the Bill gave Mr. Labouchere an
opportunity of withdrawing the “Coasting clauses”
he had previously paraded as an important feature of
it. The tone and manner of the right honourable
gentleman betrayed the humiliation he was doomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
to undergo. He discreetly, however, held his tongue
respecting the flat refusal he had received from the
United States with respect to their expected reciprocation
of the coasting trade, expatiating, instead, at
great length, on certain conferences he had had with
Sir T. Fremantle, the head of the Board of Customs,
the upshot being, that whereas Sir T. Fremantle had
previously said that the new proposed regulations
regarding the Coasting trade would not endanger the
revenue he had now changed his opinion, and, with
the officials under him, had come to the conclusion
that, if not absolutely impossible, it would be extremely
difficult to frame any regulations which
should not leave the revenue of the country exposed
to great danger if the distinction were done away
with between the coasting and general trade of the
country—that is, if a foreign or a British ship were
allowed to combine a coasting with a foreign voyage.</p>

<p>Mr. Hume saw at once that if the trade were
entirely laid open this difficulty would be removed;
but, although this was admitted, Mr. Labouchere
plausibly answered that to say to an American,
“You may come here and carry coals in our coasting
trade, but you must not combine that with a foreign
voyage,” would be quite illusory. To open the
coasting trade in this manner, it was urged, would
excite a great deal of unnecessary alarm among the
shipping classes; and, so, the coasting clauses were
hastily withdrawn. Of course, the refusal of the
American Government to reciprocate in the coasting
trade did not escape the sagacity of Mr. Herries,
who, delighted at the withdrawal of the obnoxious
clauses, declared the excuse made about the revenue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
to be wholly unsatisfactory; moreover, that it was
made known, unfortunately, just after the communication
from the American Government, so long
delayed, had been laid on the table, by which it
appeared that Government was not, otherwise, prepared
to make the proposed concessions on the
subject of this trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Bouverie’s
amendment
opposed by
Shipowners’
Committee.</div>

<p>However, in the meantime, Mr. Bouverie, member
for Kilmarnock, a Free-trader, had given notice of a
long amendment<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> to the first clause of the Bill, which
was, substantially, to the effect that the several restrictions
and prohibitions contained in the Acts recited
in the <i>1st Clause</i> (i.e. the old Navigation Laws),
with certain exceptions, should continue in full force,
till it should be shown that British ships were not
subjected in foreign countries to the like restrictions
and prohibitions. It might have been supposed that
the Shipowners would have consented to such a compromise:
but they showed no disposition to accept
this proposal. Indeed, their hostility to any alteration
mainly led to their ultimate discomfiture. At a
meeting of the Central Committee for upholding the
principle of the Navigation Laws, it was unanimously
resolved, “That the fatal consequences of the repealing
Clause, <i>No. 1</i>, in the Navigation Law Amendment
Bill, would not be removed by the amendment
of which Mr. Bouverie had given notice; and, as they
were convinced that this clause would still prove
destructive to British navigation, they trusted it
would not in any form receive the sanction of friends
to the shipping interest in Parliament.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Mr. Gladstone’s
scheme</div>

<p>This was, perhaps, the last chance offered to the
Shipowners: they, however, relied upon throwing
out the Bill, and rejected every offer at modification,
or conditional relaxation of the existing law, their
aim being to uphold those laws in their integrity.
Mr. Gladstone’s views, on the other hand, favoured
the adoption of conditional legislation, but not exactly
in the way proposed by Mr. Bouverie. He
proposed to divide the whole trade of the empire
into two divisions only: the first of them relating to
domestic or British trade; including under that head
the trade coastwise and the colonial trade. He proposed
to enact a law, not dependent on the discretion
of the ministers of the Crown, otherwise than that it
would be their business to ascertain when any country
was disposed to give Great Britain perfect freedom
in its foreign trade, and to provide in such a case
that it should receive in return her foreign trade.
Whenever any nation would propose perfect freedom
in all maritime trade, both foreign and domestic, it
would be placed on equal terms with British vessels
in all ports, foreign, colonial, and coasting. Mr.
Gladstone, however, contemplated a provision for
the foreign trade of the colonies by dealing with
that trade irrespectively of the conduct of other
countries. He suggested the repeal of every direct
restraint on the importation of tropical produce—or
non-European produce—from Europe, that being a
restraint which, according to the actual law, affected
British ships as well as those of foreign countries.
He was also for the repeal of all fiscal restraints, and
of every restraint of the nature of a tax on the British
Shipowner. He would have set him free, alike with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
respect to the command and the manning of his ship;
he would also have allowed a drawback on the
timber used in the construction of ships.</p>

<div class="sidenote">also opposed
by
the Shipowners.</div>

<p>Such were Mr. Gladstone’s views, which he was
sanguine enough to imagine would have been acceptable
to the shipping interests, had he proposed a
scheme embodying his opinions, and invited the
Legislature to make the necessary fiscal alterations.
But when Mr. Gladstone saw that both the Government
and Shipowners rejected Mr. Bouverie’s proposal,
a form as it unquestionably was of conditional legislation,
he relinquished his intention of bringing his
plan before the House, as it had in fact no chance of
being accepted by either party.</p>

<p>Such was the temper of all parties when the Bill
went into committee on the 23rd March, 1849; Mr.
Herries, before the Speaker left the chair, having
intimated his intention of opposing the Bill during all
its stages, believing that it could not be rendered a
good Bill, whatever alterations might be made in it.</p>

<p>Upon going into committee, Mr. Bouverie brought
forward his amendment. He disclaimed any desire
to defeat the measure, which he had supported by
his vote, still less did he hanker after Protection, for
it was strictly in the sense of Free-trade that he proposed
it. He only differed with Ministers as to the
mode by which the changes proposed should be
effected. They had entered into reciprocal relations
with almost every other maritime nation. The United
States had a complete system of reciprocity: it was
the foundation of their navigation system, and it was
an example it would be well to follow. The clause
he proposed would supersede the necessity of tedious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
and vexatious negotiations. Out of a score of reciprocity
treaties to which England was a party, there
were only four which contained the “favoured-nation”
clause; and it was idle to expect that, through the
instrumentality of any such compacts, genuine or extensively
reciprocal advantages could be established
as between England and the other nations of the
world. It might be difficult, if not wholly impracticable,
to realise the principle of reciprocity in the
case of tariffs, but it was not so difficult to apply
the principle to shipping. Nothing was so easy as to
say, we will relax our Navigation Laws, and make
certain arrangements with respect to our shipping interests,
on the express condition that other countries
will adopt similar arrangements and similar relaxations
in our regard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Questions
of reciprocity,
conditional
legislation,
and
retaliation.</div>

<p>If these views were unsatisfactory to the Shipowners,
it is certain they were still more so to the
extreme Free-trade party. The question had now
resolved itself into the expediency of reciprocity,
conditional legislation, and retaliation. The extreme
Free-traders demanded liberty of navigation without
any legislative restriction whatever, and the plan of
Government conferring a power of retaliation, though
one little likely to be resorted to, was of course the
plan least objectionable to the Free-traders. They
contended that the Bill as it stood enabled the
country to receive concessions from foreign countries
by making concessions to them; but, if Mr.
Bouverie’s motion was carried, they asserted that,
retaining in our hands the power of retaliation, we
should be compelled to resort to such measures
whenever equality was disturbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Details of
American
law.</div>

<p>Both parties in truth exaggerated the difficulties
of their opponent’s scheme, being attached to their
own. The real question at issue was, which country
should take the initiative in a Free-trade policy. Mr.
Wilson, as an extreme Free-trader, insisted that the
law of America sanctioned reciprocity on their part,
without having recourse to Congress, which the
members of the Shipowners’ Society controverted.
There can be no doubt that the American Law of
1828 did so authorize the President to reciprocate
any relaxation of the Navigation Laws we might on
our part resolve on. But when Mr. Buchanan had
so recently reserved the American coasting trade,
repudiating the unauthorized pledge previously given
by the American envoy, and had further frankly
stated to Mr. Crampton,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> that “it was probable some
difference of opinion would manifest itself in Congress
upon this question, from the unwillingness felt in
some quarters to throw open the ship-building business
in the United States to the competition of British
shipbuilders, and more particularly to that of the
shipbuilders of the British North American colonies;”
we might have been quite sure that Congress
would, if necessary, interfere, and, by some special
law, annul the liberal principle of the American Law
of 1828.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson and the Free-traders, affecting to be
better informed on the state of American law than
the Shipowners, went into the opposite extreme, and
expressed their entire confidence in the complete
reciprocity of the Americans; asserting further, that
without going to Congress, the Executive could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>extend to every country similar concessions as were
extended to them. Such was the impression on
both the contending parties. As to Mr. Bouverie’s
amendment, though it, in some degree, resembled
Mr. Gladstone’s views, that gentleman complained
“that his scheme had been withered by an unkind
shadow cast over it by the member for Kilmarnock,”
at the same time, refusing to discuss a plan not dissimilar
to his own, and adhering to his opinion,
that, as foreign countries were in the habit of adopting
measures to meet their own wants, England
ought to be allowed to do the same, but only on
the principle of reciprocity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Bouverie’s
plan rejected.</div>

<p>It is unnecessary to pursue this point any further.
A long debate ensued on it, in which Mr. Milner
Gibson and Mr. Bright delivered, with their usual
force, their extreme, but then unpalatable, Free-trade
opinions, while Mr. Roundell Palmer opposed any
change hostile to the principles of the Navigation
Laws. It appeared from the general feeling of the
committee, that Mr. Bouverie’s amendment had not
the slightest chance of being adopted, and he was
desirous of withdrawing it. Mr. Wawn, however,
insisted upon a division; and when a division was
taken, only fifteen members voted in favour of Mr.
Bouverie’s scheme of conditional legislation, while
132 voted against it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Disraeli’s
speech.</div>

<p>Various other divisions took place on the consideration
of the Bill in committee, and numerous important
alterations were then made, so that only
eighteen clauses were carried up to the sitting of the
23rd March. On the motion to report progress, Mr.
Disraeli protested against the whole Bill, which, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
the withdrawal of ten clauses and the modification of
four more, had received that night a serious check.
He compared the proceedings to those during the
French Revolution, on the day when the nobles and
prelates vied with each other in throwing mitres and
coronets to the dust as useless appendages. That
day was still called “the day of dupes;” and, remarked
Mr. Disraeli, “the same appellation might be
applied when referring to the events of that evening.
We have had,” he continued, “two years of
protracted legislation against the Shipowners of England.”
The course Ministers had pursued during
those two years formed no exception to the rash
policy which had characterised their proceedings with
regard to the agricultural and colonial interests.
“Have your deliberations been graver or more
thoughtful? This” (holding up the Bill), “this,” exclaimed
Mr. Disraeli, “is my answer. Ministers
acting in this manner,” he continued, “did more than
injure and destroy the material interests of the
nation; they laid the foundation of a stock of political
discontent, which would not merely diminish
the revenues of the kingdom and the fortunes of its
subjects, but would shake the institutions of the
country to its centre.” After Mr. Gladstone and Mr.
Labouchere had spoken in reply, the committee
reported progress.</p>

<p>When the committee resumed its sittings on the
26th March, the Retaliatory Clause (19) became a
subject of discussion. The several leaders again
delivered their opinions on this much-controverted
point, the Free-traders wishing to omit the clause
altogether; while Mr. G. Sanders intimated an intention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
of making the Bill operate for a limited
term, so as to ascertain whether Foreign Powers
would reciprocate or not. The clause, however, was
finally carried without a division; but Clause 22,
enabling the Queen to reduce the differential duties
in certain cases, opened the wide question of dock
dues and light dues, in which public and private
rights were so confusedly intermingled that it was
ultimately withdrawn. The remaining clauses passed
with some opposition, the preamble, however, being
agreed to. Thus this celebrated Bill now assumed
a formal shape; but its opponents, conscious of their
power in the House of Lords, gave notice of a last
trial of strength upon the third reading.</p>

<p>On the 19th April, Captain Harris made an ineffectual
attempt to carry a clause, on the consideration
of the Report, enforcing the apprenticeship laws, and
Mr. Gladstone obtained a modification of the Bill
with regard to the mode of finally adjusting the
intercolonial trade by the colonial legislatures.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Third
reading of
Bill.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Herries’
speech.</div>

<p>During the Easter recess, meetings of the shipping
interests had been held in various outports, and the
whole power of the Shipowners had been put forth to
defeat the Bill. On the 23rd April the Bill stood
for the third reading, and the venerable Mr. Herries
once more headed the party of Anti-Repealers to
make a last effort in the House of Commons to reject
the Bill. His speech was well prepared, and suitable
to the occasion. He very briefly alluded to the points
already decided, but dwelt with great force on the
Bancroft letter, asserting that nothing had passed
relative to the United States, which ought for a
moment to weigh with Parliament, in changing its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
determination to maintain the Navigation Laws.
“Let English commerce now speak!” he exclaimed.
“Look at the petitions against the Bill, comprising
the greatest names in the City.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> In Liverpool 47,000
persons had signed petitions against the Bill; and
among these were 1000 mercantile firms of great
note and respectability. This was without precedent
in the history of petitions; whilst a counter-petition
contained but 1400 names, among which were not
found 100 trading firms.” Mr. Herries denied that the
subject had any necessary connection with Free-trade.
The experiment might be continued, and yet, with
perfect consistency, while abstaining from any interference
with the main structure and fundamental
principles of the Navigation Laws. These laws
had always, he alleged, been considered an exception
to the general laws affecting trade. After
an elaborate speech, Mr. Herries concluded by
moving that the Bill be read a third time that
day six months. Alderman Thompson seconded the
amendment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Robinson.</div>

<p>A very animated discussion ensued. Mr. Robinson
went over the old topics, and said that the new
republican Government of France had advertised for
the importation of 38,000 tons of coals into France,
one of the conditions being that they should be imported
exclusively in French vessels. So much for the
Navigation Laws of France. The National Assembly
had also introduced another measure by which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>importation of salt in French vessels subjected to a
duty only of 75c., while that imported in British
vessels was required to pay a duty of 2f. 75c. So
much for Free-trade with France. He trusted the
majority in favour of the ministry would be so small
as to induce the Government to pause in their career.</p>

<p>Mr. Macgregor, in a very long speech, supported
the Bill, though he wished it had been a more
complete measure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Walpole.</div>

<p>He was followed by Mr. Walpole against the Bill,
who quoted the Venetian proverb,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and said—“Let us
first be Englishmen, and then economists.” He considered
the Navigation Law the wisest of our regulations.
It had given us safety and independence at
home; it had afforded security to our colonies abroad;
it had protected our trade in every part of the world,
and it would protect it, if the laws were not repealed,
against all chances of war; and, while it had done
this effectually and completely, it had also preserved
for them the supremacy on the ocean, by which more
than once they had been able to bid defiance to the
whole world, when our honour and interests were
assailed. Mr. Walpole concluded by borrowing the
splendid peroration of Mr. Disraeli in that gentleman’s
speech at the second reading.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir James
Graham.</div>

<p>Sir James Graham next rose, and, differing much
on some points from the supporters of the Bill,
intimated, in an exhaustive speech, his intention
of voting for the third reading. Pointing to Sir
Francis T. Baring, who sat on the Treasury Bench
as First Lord of the Admiralty, the head of the
house of Baring, he expressed his disbelief that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>he would be an assenting party to a measure
which, in his conscience, he felt would be injurious
to the character and welfare of that commercial
navy, to which he and his family for generations
had been so much indebted, or that he would give
the weight of his influence to a measure which, in
his judgment, risked the power and greatness of
the Royal Navy, more especially confided by her
Majesty to his care. Liverpool had been mentioned.
Why, the two members for Liverpool have voted
for the Bill.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> So also did the two members for
Newcastle and Glasgow.</p>

<p>Sir James Graham added, that, however valuable
reciprocity might have been, when Mr. Huskisson
considered the question in the abstract, he, Sir
James, was not much attached to it now. It might
have been wise and politic at the time; but he
could not help thinking that it made the interest
of others the measure of our interest, he had
almost said it made the folly of others the limit
of our wisdom. With respect to reciprocity and
to retaliation, which is reciprocity in another shape,
as a general rule he would rather leave the
Navigation Laws as they were than adopt that
principle. What is retaliation? he asked. It is
this: because some foreign nation does that which
is more injurious to herself than it is to ourselves,
we, in the spirit of blind, vindictive passion, proceed
to do that which is more injurious to ourselves
than to our rivals. To reciprocity and to retaliation,
as a rule, Sir James was opposed; but he
supported the Bill, on the whole, because without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>having recourse to either the one or the other,
and considering the character of the people of this
country, their capital, their undaunted courage, and
the advantages they possessed in the race they
had already run, he was satisfied that any measure
throwing open the trade of the world would
greatly increase commerce, and that the lion’s share
of the addition would fall to our lot. Every reason,
he argued, existing, in the days of Mr. Huskisson, for
the relaxation of the system existed in a yet stronger
degree at the present moment; and, quoting the
expression employed by Lord Stanley, <i>Vestigia nulla
retrorsum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> as applicable to the recent Free-trade
policy, he concluded a highly elaborate speech by
remarking that Protection or no Protection was the
question at issue; and, as the present measure would
crown the work they had already accomplished, he
was opposed to reaction, and favourable to progress
tempered by prudence and discretion. Upon these
grounds he supported the third reading.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. T.
Baring.</div>

<p>Mr. Thomas Baring avowed his opinion that, as a
general principle, restriction must be an injury to
trade. If the whole community were to be regarded
as a community of merchants, certainly it was desirable
to allow the importers to get their wants
supplied, and ship their goods where and whence
they pleased. If we were, like the inhabitants of the
Hanseatic Towns, mere receivers and distributors,
then we might say, let every other consideration be
disregarded. But the real grievances of the merchants
might fairly be taken from their representations, and,
if they had sustained such grievances as had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>represented, surely they would not have been either
indifferent or adverse to the removal of those laws.
If he understood the Bill rightly, it was framed
on the principle of removing all restrictions on
foreigners, and of maintaining restrictions on Englishmen.
Let the House mark, he said, that Government
which, after great research and trouble in
obtaining information, had told us that there was an
inferiority on the part of our captains and sailors,
now told the Shipowners that they were to compete
with those, who had the power of employing better
workmen. The only facility given by the Bill to
Shipowners was the privilege of building ships
abroad; on this he would make one remark, that
every person knew the difficulty of recovering a
manufacture once lost.</p>

<p>With respect to conditional legislation, suggested
by Mr. Gladstone, public opinion was divided on
it in the United States. Sweden, in such a case,
had nothing to give. Holland could only give one-third,
as the Dutch Commercial Company carried
on the other two-thirds of the Dutch trade by contract
in Dutch vessels. As regards the United
States, he was satisfied Mr. Bancroft did not intend
to practise a deception. The navigation of the
United States offered advantages which might be of
account; yet there the favoured-nation clause came
in to create difficulties, and it might be that we would
feel compelled to abandon the Navigation Laws with
respect to those States, or relinquish the advantages
which were offered prospectively. We ought to
adhere to the main principles of the Navigation
Laws in all instances, and make such concessions to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
each country as our interests might dictate as
expedient. The principles of Free-trade ought to
be applied to each measure under discussion, according
as our particular interests were affected
thereby. Sir James Graham had put the question
as one decisive between retreat and progress.
Reaction was as much to be feared as a rash
progress, for reaction might be fraught with suffering
to the people, as dangerous to the interests
of the country as the proposed change was ominous
of evil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord J.
Russell.</div>

<p>Lord John Russell as Chief Minister of the Crown
wound up the debate on his side. He was aware
that the law had been almost worshipped as the
<i>charta maritima</i> of this country, and that, much of our
prosperity and commerce having been attributed to
this law, it had been thought profanation to alter it.
He thought this was an opinion founded in error,
and that, at no time, had this law been essentially
advantageous to this country. He then went over
the history of the Navigation Laws, quoting authors
of various times who wrote of the fluctuations in
trade and public policy, and having reviewed the
several points of the question, came to the conclusion
that with respect to the greater part of the
nations of Europe and of the world, we would obtain
fair and equal terms of navigation, provided we were
ready to give the same terms to them. He went
farther; he boldly said that nobody could doubt
that in the case of the United States of America, or
in those of Prussia, Russia, or Austria, the fullest
reciprocity would be conceded. The nations which
would not give equal terms were, at the most, only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
three or four—France, Spain, and Belgium, and
perhaps one other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Disraeli.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Majority
for Bill,
61.</div>

<p>Mr. Disraeli assumed the privilege of the last
word, and, in reply, quoted the last report of the
Shipowners’ Society, which has been already given,
intimating their readiness to discuss the policy of
amending the Navigation Laws on all points not
involving fundamental principles. He next took a
rapid review of the effects of repeal on the Australian
and other colonies, arguing that, if Canada
had not a Protective duty on corn restored to it,
as demanded by the Legislative Assembly, Canada
would be lost to the British Crown. “Woe to those
statesmen and to the policy which plucked this jewel
from the Crown of England! No shuffling change
in the Navigation Law could compensate the people
of Canada for what they had lost, and which they
felt so acutely.” Mr. Disraeli then referred to the
papers from foreign Powers, arguing that they
were valueless, and, especially, that everything respecting
the United States was a <i>tabula rasa</i>, all that
we had heard last year having been obliterated as an
element of consideration. The last division on this
famous Bill now took place upon the third reading,
when the Ayes were 275; Noes, 214; Majority, 61.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Debate in
the Lords,
7th May,
1849, on
the second
reading.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Speech
of the
Marquess
of Lansdowne.</div>

<p>Although the majority in favour of the Bill had
slightly increased since the division had been taken
on the second reading in the House of Commons, the
Shipowners were not discouraged, believing it would
be thrown out by the Lords. They knew that the
ministry had staked their reputation upon it, and that
the fate of the Government depended on the result,
but they confidently believed that the Upper House
would reject “so pernicious a measure.” The Bill was
at once carried up to the Lords, and read a first time
on Tuesday, 24th April; and on Monday, 7th May,
the Marquess of Lansdowne moved the second reading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
in a long and elaborate speech. He contended
that the origin of the Navigation Laws during the
Protectorate of Cromwell did not arise so much from
a commercial or political want as from a desire to
punish the Dutch for their loyal support to Charles I.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
He admitted, however, that there were then good
grounds for trying the experiment how far the
national arm could be strengthened by restriction,
and how far the naval force of the country could be
thus increased. The noble Marquess next traced at
length the changes contemplated by Mr. Pitt, and
the incidents of the war with Napoleon, contending
that the law, by successive changes, had ceased to
be a suit of impenetrable armour, and was now only
an imperfect garment of shreds and patches, manufactured
out of parchments from statute books. He,
further, showed the increase of our shipping since
the relaxation of the shipping laws, maintaining
that the dread of foreign competition was altogether
irrational, and demonstrating, by statistics, the large
share of the American direct and carrying trade
we had already secured in open competition with
American ships hence, and with foreign ships from
their own ports to American shores; while we were,
at the same time, able to bear off the chief share of
the Russian trade from the Baltic ships even within
the heart of their own country. He briefly referred
to the colonial bearing of the question, and said that
the West Indies were subject to great troubles, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
Canada engaged in a difficult competition with the
United States, the whole trade of the St. Lawrence
depending on the repeal of that part of the Navigation
Laws still in operation, the complete opening of
that river alone, he thought, being sufficient to enable
her to retain the trade now fast passing through the
United States. The Marquess quoted Bonaparte,
whose aim, when at the summit of his power, had
been to obtain ships, colonies, and commerce. Bonaparte
conquered one-half of Europe; the other half
he seduced or entrapped into negotiations. He could
create monopolies everywhere, and did so unscrupulously;
but the genius of English commerce overcame
those monopolies. Ships he could not get;
colonies he could not acquire; commerce he could
not establish; and was this, he asked, a consequence
of the British Navigation Laws? No; it
was British commerce and enterprise, which, in spite
of restrictions in all parts of the world, secured
a footing; and, in spite of edicts enforced by a
million of bayonets, was established and conducted
successfully. The Marquess then explained that the
Administration depended upon this question, and
were prepared for all the consequences of a hostile
vote.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord
Brougham.</div>

<p>To the astonishment of the country, Lord Brougham,
in one of the ablest, or at least the most rhetorical
speeches<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> he perhaps ever delivered even in his best
days, opposed the second reading of the Bill. His
Lordship had supported the other great measures
of Free-trade, and now did not escape the charge of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>inconsistency, which he most eloquently denied. “I
will only say,” he exclaimed, “that I glory in what
forms the subject matter of this taunt. I glory in
having obtained those immortal victories over antiquated
error; in having made to triumph the
soundest principles of political philosophy, sweeping
away the groundless prejudices by which its progress
was obstructed heretofore. But if there is one
passage of my political life dearer than another to
my remembrance, and any drop in the cup of exultation
more particularly sweet to my palate, it is the
recollection of those worthy, eminent persons, leaders
of the revilers, the distinguished statesmen whose
support I enjoyed after passing a long life in opposition
to them on this very question, and who
crowned themselves with honour by abandoning
their own errors in vindicating the truth. But
it is not now with them as with me. I make
no change in my opinions.” The noble Lord then
plunged into the Orders of Council<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> during the war,
in the discussion of which he took such a conspicuous
part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condemnation
of Mr.
Porter’s
statistics.</div>

<p>In speaking of the tables from the Board of Trade
and Customs, he said a lively impression prevailed on
all sides, that they could prove anything and everything.
Indeed, it had been remarked, give me half
an hour, and the run of the multiplication table, and
I’ll engage to pay off the National Debt. In statistics
it is easy to add a little here, and subtract a little
there, quietly to slip in a figure—it may be a cypher
among your data—slyly to make what seems a reasonable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>postulate in your premises, but which turns out
to be a begging of the question; and, behold, you
gain your point and triumph; until, it is found that
your adversary, having access to the same stores of
arithmetic, proves his case, and refutes yours, with
the same facility. Such are statistics when severed
from sound principle and plain reasoning. But how
little are these to be relied on when prepared by
those in the employ of one party? To trust oneself
among such details would be perilous in the extreme.
“My noble friend has fared forth into the labyrinth
with such bad success, that his fate seems to warn
me how I venture to follow his perilous course. But
there remains to deter me, like a beacon on the same
coast, the sad wreck of another adventurer, the good
ship <i>Board of Trade</i>, G. R. Porter, Master, cast
away on the shoals of these faithless waters.” The
noble Lord then assailed Mr. Porter with the whole
force of his sarcasm. He said: “Mr. Porter, showing
the comparative progress of English and American
tonnage, takes the whole of one part and only part
of the other, and thus makes out the result which
suits his argument. Lord Hardwicke, the chairman,
put this question to the witness, after stating the
entire difference of the two returns, the difference
being total in one case and partial in the other.
‘Then, consequently, these returns are not to be taken
compared together, as showing in any degree the
comparative value of British and American tonnage?’
Mark the answer of the hapless Mr. Porter.
‘Certainly not.’” The noble Lord then went on
tearing, in the opinion of the opponents of the Bill,
Mr. Porter’s evidence to shreds. “I am reminded,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
said his Lordship, “of the cooking of the returns.
But here we had called up the chief cook to examine
him. We asked, ‘Is this dish pure?’ ‘Not at all,’
he answered. ‘Is it nutritive?’ ‘Nothing of the
kind.’ ‘Is it safe and wholesome to eat?’ ‘Certainly
not?’ ‘Have you any means of correcting
its poison by an antidote?’ ‘I am not sure; I
rather think I have; but I am not certain.’”
The noble Lord then referred to the reciprocity
treaties; the fact being that these treaties were all
respecting differential duties; all of them were
grounded on the comparatively sound principle of
only relaxing our monopoly in favour of those States
who agreed to give us the <i>quid pro quo</i>; whereas the
present scheme was to give the <i>quid</i> without the <i>quo</i>;
to sweep away all restriction at once with every
country before we secured an equivalent from any
one; and so far from proportioning our sacrifice to
our gain, to sacrifice everything before we gained
anything.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protected
and unprotected
trade.</div>

<p>“On the statistics of the protected and unprotected
trades,” continued his Lordship, “it is, that
the greatest errors have been committed. It was
among these shoals that Mr. Porter had left a
wreck, as a beacon to warn us how we follow his
course. He, no doubt, had steered to the best of
his ability, and quite unconsciously had been cast
away; but, that he acted under the bias of a strong
prejudice in favour of his ally and relative, the
author of the present Bill, is very much to be
suspected, for we all know that the Bill is really
Mr. Ricardo’s, who, in 1847, moved the Committee
on the Navigation Laws, the Government being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
afterwards pushed on by their supporters, impatient
at seeing them hold their places and do nothing.”
After dissecting these tables with a ruthless
hand, Lord Brougham asked how any rational man
could place reliance upon tables thus framed, and
thus abounding on their face with errors the most
fatal. Their great concoctor is asked about these
errors, and he cannot deny them, so he says the
heading of the return is wrong, and that instead
of “unprotected,” it should have been “less protected.”
Indeed! But that is just giving up the
whole value of the table, and making it utterly useless—utterly
unfit to be the ground of any inference
whatever—utterly foreign to the present question.
For, observe, we can understand what is meant by
a trade unprotected by the Navigation Laws, and
compare it with one that is protected; but a trade
“less protected,” how is that to be defined? Less
protected than what? What does this tell us?
What makes more, what less? How can we compare
them together? All depends upon how much more
and how much less, and this Mr. Porter does not
affect to show.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyages
to the
continent.</div>

<p>“But,” exclaimed his Lordship, “this is not the
worst of it by a great deal!” He then sifted the whole
returns about the voyages to the continent, to which
I have already referred. “My Lords, I will readily
give a large licence for exaggeration to that lively
class of persons who contribute to our amusement by
their powers of imagination, drawing upon their
fancy for their facts, and on their memory for their
jests. To these men I render all grateful homage, as
among the gayest of our sad species; so far as fourfold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
or even tenfold, I am willing to extend my
licence. But what shall we say of a hundredfold,
nay, a hundred-and-fiftyfold, and that, not by the
lively wit, but by the plodding dealer in returns,
tables, and trade and shipping statistics. I must
really send them away to bury themselves and their
errors in the recesses of the trade department, and
no longer hope to obtain any faith here. I have done
with such food, such dry food even when it is honestly
prepared and fairly served up.”</p>

<p>Lord Brougham then entered fully into the merits
of the general question, calling upon their Lordships
not to part rashly with what had been called the
miserable remnants, the fragments of a worn-out
system. “Fragments, indeed! They are of gigantic
size; they are the splendid remains of a mighty system;
they are the pillars of our navy; the props of
our maritime defence.” He showed that there remained
the almost entire monopoly of our home
trade, and the perfectly rigorous monopoly of our
colonial trade, employing above a million and a half
of shipping, and 20,000 seamen, with a capital that
gave export and import to between fifteen and sixteen
millions sterling in the year. He further insisted
that the restrictions affecting Canada could
be easily removed without unsettling our whole
policy.</p>

<p>The policy of the Navigation Laws rested, in his
opinion, on the position that, without such a partial
monopoly as they gave to British shipping, we never
could maintain a sufficiently ample nursery for our
navy, an object of primary importance to every
insular empire, and, therefore, to be sought at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
considerable sacrifice of the wealth unfettered commerce
might more rapidly accumulate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Napoleon’s
desire
for
ships,
colonies,
and commerce.</div>

<p>The Emperor Napoleon I. has been cited as
having wished “for ships, colonies, and commerce.”
The quotation is not quite accurate.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> He inveighed
against “the ships, colonies, and commerce
of England,” and mentioned these as the object of
his hostility; whence Mr. Pitt, at a Guildhall festival,
gave as a retaliatory toast, “the ships, colonies,
and commerce of England,” a retort which
derived its point from the French Emperor’s hostility
against these special objects. Lord Brougham,
in his splendid declamatory style, showed how Napoleon
must have wished in vain—for we had swept the
seas of his navy, captured all his colours—because we
had created our own marine, which, he argued, owed
its existence entirely to the encouragement the Navigation
Laws gave to ship-building, and the facilities
lent by the same laws to the manning our fleets, which
that encouragement had created. For nearly two
hundred years, he continued, we had abided by that
policy; and holding steadily our course, neither swerving
to the right nor to the left, never abandoning it,
only adapting it to varying events which have altered
the distribution of dominion in other regions, we
have upheld the system which has made our navy
the envy of our rivals, the terror of our enemies,
and the admiration of the world. “Are you,” exclaimed
his Lordship, with one of those bursts of
ready eloquence for which he was so conspicuous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>in debate, “prepared to abandon a system to which
you owe so precious a possession, not only the foundation
of your glory, the bulwark of your strength,
but the protection of your very existence as a
nation?”</p>

<p>“The Bill,” continued Lord Brougham, “contained
the seeds of fresh agitation and new demand.” The
coasting trade, as well as the manning clauses, “would
excite new agitation by other Ricardos and other
Cobdens.” In framing his judgment on this great
question he had listened but to one voice, the voice
of public duty, sinking all party, all personal considerations.
He did not on any account, personal or
public, desire any change in the government. But
he was prepared to encounter that, rather than see
the highest interests of the empire exposed to ruin.
This measure he could not bear, because our national
defence could not bear it. To sweeten the bitter cup
which it would fill, we are told, and he firmly believed
it, that it would encourage slavery and stimulate
the infernal slave-trade; since, whatever cheapened
navigation between this country and the mart for
slave-grown sugar—whatever lets in the Americans,
the Swedes, the Danes, the Dutch, to bring over the
sugars of Cuba and the Brazils—must of necessity increase
the African slave-trade, by which the increase
of those sugars was promoted. “When this new
ingredient is poured into the chalice commended to
my lips to-night I can no longer hesitate, even if I
felt doubts before. All lesser considerations of party
policy or Parliamentary tactics at once give way;
and I have a question before me on which I cannot
pause or falter, or treat or compromise; and, regardless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
of the comfort in any quarter, careless with what
arrangements of any individuals my voice may interfere,
I know my duty, and will perform it: as an
honest man, an Englishman, a Peer of Parliament, I
will lift that voice to resist the further progress of
the Bill.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earl Granville</div>

<p>Earl Granville, in replying to Lord Brougham’s
speech, defended Mr. Porter, and especially his statistics;
but, as the reasons he and his party gave in
support of the measure have in a great degree been
confirmed by events, and by the success of the change
they then so boldly advocated, it is more desirable
to record at greater length the opinions of the opponents
to the Bill. From these a lesson may be taught
to other nations, which still cling to a policy in favour
of which no more powerful arguments could be
adduced than those urged by some of the ablest men
of the period, arguments, however, which experience
has shown, in almost every instance, to have been
fallacious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earl of
Ellenborough.</div>

<p>Lord Ellenborough<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> was unwilling, under existing
circumstances, to diminish our marine by one ship, or
our seamen by one man, and this Bill would tend to
undermine the strength of our navy, both in ships
and men. He contended that, as there had been a
much larger increase in the British tonnage employed
in the trade with the British North American colonies
than in that of all the rest of the trade with America,
fragmentary as the system might be, it evidently
produced the effect it was intended to produce, the
maintenance and increase of British navigation, and,
therein, the security of this country. The noble Lord
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>then drew a picture of our colonial empire, and
pointed out the great and increasing demand on our
naval resources for purpose of defence. He next
directed attention to the well-appointed navy of the
United States, of Russia, France, Austria, Naples,
and other Continental Powers; and said we should
do wrong if we did not consider the present state of
the navies of foreign Powers in conjunction with the
changes which have taken place in their military
position. The military peace establishments of foreign
Powers were now equal to their war establishments
of former times; while the substitution of railways
in the place of ordinary roads will enable States to
bring a preponderating force, suddenly, from the
most distant quarters to the port of embarkation, and
then they will find “a steam bridge” from the continent
to these islands.</p>

<p>Lord Harrowby, in an exhaustive speech, argued
that wherever the “interests of commerce and navigation
were at variance” those of navigation must
predominate, as essential to the defence and security
of the empire; but his Lordship, and all
other speakers, entirely failed to prove that they
ever were at variance. Nor can they be so. They
rise and fall with each other; and are essentially
one and the same. Indeed, if closely scrutinised,
they will be found to have no antagonistic principles;
and further, that whatever antagonism existed
was caused by the operation of the Navigation
Laws. Lord Grey, who followed Lord Harrowby,
clearly showed that while these laws were of no
advantage to the Shipowner, they were, from their
practical working, serious drawbacks to his success,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
and that, instead of affording him any real protection,
they were detrimental to his best interests. He
further showed that the Navigation Laws were unfavourable
to the development of the warehousing
system; and, afterwards, dwelt at great length on the
colonial part of the question and on the claims of
Canada; asserting, also, that we could only perpetuate
the connection between the mother-country and the
North American colonies by engaging the confidence
and participating in the affections of their people.
The Navigation Laws were, he remarked, among the
proximate causes of the revolutionary struggle which
had ended in the independence of the United States.
He concluded with an impressive appeal to the House
not to peril the interests of the country by rejecting
the Bill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Stanley.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Admits
need of
modifications.</div>

<p>Lord Stanley,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> on the second night of the debate,
rose at a quarter-past one o’clock, to answer Earl
Grey, then Colonial Minister. After alluding to the
recent Free-trade policy, with which this question
was not connected, his Lordship asked whether they
were prepared to abolish a system which, for two
centuries at least, had formed the basis of our national
greatness and the foundation of our naval strength.
He had no objection to the modifications the Navigation
Laws had undergone, nor might he object to
some further modifications now. But it was not on
the modification of these laws that the House had
now to decide, but upon the momentous question of
their entire abolition. Were they prepared for such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>a step, when it was admitted that, if taken, it must
be irrevocable? Earl Grey, he said, treated the
Navigation Laws as disadvantageous to the mercantile
interests of the country. The merchants had
not made this discovery, but the Queen’s Government
had made it for them. The whole case, as based on
its assumed benefits to the commercial marine, therefore
fell to the ground; and the objection to the Bill,
founded on its injurious tendency, so far as the navy
was concerned, remained unchallenged and unrefuted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Canada
not our
only
colony.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Majority
for Bill,
10.</div>

<p>In Canada, as in all other colonies, the withdrawal
of Protection was regarded as a great grievance,
hence the repeal of the Navigation Laws was
demanded by them only as a consequence of that
event. But our North American colonies were not
confined to Canada. The shipbuilding colonies of
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were opposed to
repeal. The exceptional case of Canada might be
met without entirely abrogating these laws. Having
severely condemned Lord Palmerston for his circular,
Lord Stanley then endeavoured to show that the
warehousing system owed its origin to existing prohibitions,
and that its increase or permanence depended
upon their maintenance. He strongly objected to
the proposal of admitting a foreign-built ship to
British registry. It was essential, he maintained,
to keep up the number and efficiency of our private
building-yards, which would speedily decrease in
number were such a proposal adopted. The question,
indeed, could not be decided by one vote. The British
merchants, the British Shipowners, the British seamen,
and the British mechanics would not be satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
with a Bill passed by a bare majority of the
House, under pressure never heard of before, and
with menaces such as had been thrown out. The
people of this country will never know when they
are beaten. The Marquess of Lansdowne having replied,
repelling in indignant language the charge
of having used menaces, the House went to a division
at half-past four o’clock on the morning of the 10th
May, on the question that “now” stand part of the
motion. There appeared, Contents, present, 105;
Proxies, 68; Total, 173: Non-contents, present, 119;
Proxies, 44: Total, 163: Majority, 10!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duke of
Wellington
votes
for it.</div>

<p>This division was regarded at the time as of great
political importance. Much uncertainty and speculation
had before prevailed as to the relative state of
parties upon the question in the House of Lords,
and the fate of the Administration was generally
supposed to depend on the decision as to the second
reading of the Bill. The Shipowners were in the
highest degree exasperated that they should be defeated
by that which they called a pocket majority of
proxies, as they had actually a majority of the Peers
present adverse to the Bill. Perhaps that which
occasioned the deepest mortification to them was that
the Duke of Wellington, who had recently called
attention to the state of the national defences,
voted with the majority. With so narrow a majority
as ten against them, the Shipowners resolved to
make fresh efforts to obtain another division in
committee, when, as proxies could not be accepted,
it was anticipated that the obnoxious measure would
be so altered, as to deprive it of its most objectionable
features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>Accordingly Lord Stanley on the 18th May gave
notice that he intended to propose the rejection of
all the repealing clauses, <i>i.e.</i> the first and second,
and, in point of fact, make the principle of the Bill
one of conditional legislation. He proposed, farther,
to enable British ships to bring the produce of Asia,
Africa, and America indirectly, and to modify in the
same spirit the clauses relating to the European
trade. It should be remarked that the alarming
news of an extensive rebellion in Canada had reached
England since the day of the second reading, and a
growing desire was felt that this great question of
repeal should be finally settled one way or the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proceedings

<div class="sidenote">Lord
Stanley’s
amendment.</div>

<p>In committee on the Bill (21st May), Lord Stanley
brought forward his amendment, Lord Wharncliffe
having given notice of one of the same or nearly
similar tendency. The object of Lord Wharncliffe’s<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
amendment was that, until her Majesty should be
fully satisfied that foreign countries would grant
full reciprocity and commerce to this country, her
Majesty should have no power to abrogate or repeal
the Navigation Laws, so far as they affected the
ships and commerce of those countries. Lord Stanley’s
aimed at the same object. His Lordship said
the distinction between his measure and that of the
Government assumed this shape. Should we proceed
to repeal, and then to re-enact a small portion, yet a
portion, of the Navigation Laws which was the most
burdensome to the British owner and the least
advantageous to British commerce? or should the
repeal be made conditional, by an enabling clause
which conferred on the Queen the requisite power,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>when satisfied that reciprocity was accorded to
us?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rejected
by 13.</div>

<p>The question gave rise to a very long and animated
discussion, in which Earl Grey, the Earl of
Harrowby, Earl Granville, Lord Colchester, the
Marquess of Clanricarde, Lord Brougham, Lord Fitzwilliam,
and the Marquess of Lansdowne took part;
Lord Wharncliffe severing himself from Lord Stanley,
and, in fact, voting against his amendment. The
division which terminated this discussion was decisive
of the fate of the Bill. On the question of Lord
Stanley’s amendment there appeared, Contents, 103;
Non-contents, 116: Majority against the amendment,
13! As no proxies in this division influenced the
result, Lord Stanley at once withdrew all opposition
to the repeal of the 8 &amp; 9 Vict. cap. 88, which he
only wished amended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earl of
Ellenborough’s
amendment.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Claims of
Shipowners,</div>

<div class="sidenote">and fear of
competition.</div>

<p>The Committee of the Lords sat again on the 24th
May, when Lord Ellenborough moved an amendment
that instead of the Bill coming into operation
on the 1st January, 1850, it should come into
operation on the 1st January, 1851. This amendment
was in accordance with the prayer of a petition from
the General Shipowners’ Society, urging various
reasons for delay. It was admitted, his Lordship
said, that one of the chief objects of the measure
was to diminish the rates of freight; and it was
contended that the greater the competition between
the shipping of foreign States and the shipping of
this country the greater would be the diminution of
the rate of freight generally; but, added his Lordship,
British Shipowners have not the means of
diminishing their expenditure at once, so as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
enable them to compete with foreign shipowners
upon equal terms, before the Act came into operation.
The time allowed for preparation, he continued, was
only seven months; but, during that period, a large
number of British vessels would not have arrived
from distant places abroad, and, therefore, there
would be no means of making changes in the modes
of sailing and manning them. The contemplated
reduction of men required to be made by the owners
of ships to enable them to compete with the foreign
owners was held to be of great importance. It was
computed that five men were employed in every
British vessel to every 100 tons; while, in foreign
vessels, only three or four men were required for
the same amount of tonnage. Assuming 230,000
as the number of seamen employed by British shipowners,
there must be a reduction of one-fifth; in
other words, 47,500 British sailors must be thrown
out of employment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amendment
rejected
by
a majority
of 12.</div>

<p>In mercy, therefore, exclaimed his Lordship, to all
parties interested, a sufficiently long time ought to be
given for preparation. There was not less, it was said,
than 200,000 tons of American<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> shipping in California,
which might return by the port of Calcutta, and then be
brought into competition with the tonnage of this country.
The effect of the sudden competition from the
Americans in the freight-market of India on the trade
of Australia would, in his opinion, be most detrimental.
Our own vessels carried out emigrants to that dependency,
and they could only find return cargoes by
going to the ports of India; but there, again, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>would meet American tonnage from California, and
be disappointed of freights. Seven months was not
sufficient time to frame treaties with foreign Powers.
The timber duties ought to be taken off, and this
could not be done in time. His Lordship recapitulated
many other objections to such precipitancy, but
all were unavailing. The Ministers resolutely persevered
in their measure, and opposed delay, and,
indeed, every other amendment proposed. In fact,
it was believed that they were afraid, if the delay of
eighteen months were conceded, that a change of
ministry or of public opinion might defeat the measure
entirely, and this was the more to be dreaded
as all parties admitted that immediate distress to
the Shipowner must follow the first passing of the
Bill. However, the throwing open the trade of
the St. Lawrence was made the ostensible ground of
resisting delay, and upon a division only 40 Contents
appeared for Lord Ellenborough’s amendment; Non-contents,
56; Majority, 12.</p>

<p>Earl Waldegrave next moved a very long amendment,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
the general effect of which was to prevent
foreign ships from receiving British registration.
On a division there were, Contents, 37; Non-contents,
49: Majority, 12.</p>

<p>After this division Lord Stanley relinquished all
further opposition to the Bill in committee. He
withdrew an amendment which had for its object to
meet the complaint of Canada, that there were
greater facilities for the transmission of their produce
by the way of New York than by the St. Lawrence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>because, at New York, the Canadians had the choice
of an American or a British ship, while, from Montreal
or Quebec, they could only send their produce
in a British ship. Lord Stanley proposed to effect
the object, not by enabling ships of all countries to
enter the St. Lawrence, but by enabling British or
American shipping to convey from either outlet the
produce of Canada or of the United States. His
Lordship seemed to feel himself that this was, if not
an impracticable, at least a very imperfect scheme, as
it did not legislate for other colonies, and so he relinquished
it together with his general opposition. Lord
Wharncliffe, finding Lord Stanley did not support
him, withdrew his amendment also, leaving conditional
legislation to the discretion of the Crown;
that is, leaving the Queen’s Government to judge
of the expediency of asking for restrictions in particular
cases. The remaining clauses were agreed
to.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bill read
a third
time.</div>

<p>All effectual opposition to the Bill was now hopeless.
But, on the third reading, Lord Ellenborough
took the opportunity of observing that he could not
refrain from touching upon the measures which it
would be absolutely necessary to adopt for the
security of British shipping under the new system.
It was only fair that the Shipowner, among various
other burdens which he named, should be relieved
from all duties on timber. Government should
promptly introduce measures for the examination of
masters and mates before their appointments, and for
their trial upon the loss of ships; also for the establishment
of a fund for the support of worn-out
seamen, similar in principle though not in extent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
that existing for the seamen of the Royal Navy at
Greenwich Hospital; also a measure for the registry
of ships, the present system being altogether erroneous
and deceptive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Timber
duties, &amp;c.,
admitted
to be grievances.</div>

<p>Earl Granville agreed with Lord Ellenborough as
to the reduction of the timber duty; and, as to the
new registration, he was not prepared to say that he
saw any great objection to it. With regard to the
Merchant Seaman’s Fund, the attempt to restore it
made last year, he must remind their Lordships, was
opposed and defeated by the Shipowners themselves;
the subject was, nevertheless, deserving of the best
consideration. It was intended, he added, to bring in a
Bill to improve the discipline of the mercantile navy.</p>

<p>Lord Winchelsea, a staunch Conservative, complained
that the measure had been carried by the
votes of the bishops; and warned them of the danger
of carrying secular matters injurious to the best
interests of the country by their votes, as in that
case England would wish to see Convocation restored,
and the bishops represented by a few of their body.
Lord Stanley and Lord Brougham satisfied themselves
with saying, “Non-content,” and inveighing
against the Bill to the last. The Marquess of Lansdowne
replied; and the opposition Peers now withdrew
in a body, and the Bill was read a third time.</p>

<p>On the question “that the Bill do now pass,” the
Bishop of Oxford proposed to add a clause by way of
rider declaring that “the said privileges” should not
extend to the ships of Spain or Brazil, or to the ships
of any foreign country, until the Queen should
declare by Order in Council that such governments
had given full satisfaction as to the fulfilment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
the treaties respecting the suppression of the slave-trade.
The motion was resisted by Lord Howden
in a very argumentative speech, and rejected upon
a division by—Non-contents, 23; Contents, 9.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Stanley’s
protest.</div>

<p>The various reasons urged against the Bill for the
repeal of the Navigation Laws were briefly summed
up by Lord Stanley in a protest which he entered
on the Journals of the House against the third reading.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
In this protest the great advantages we surrendered,
without any equivalent, were fully recited;
and a dissent expressed, because the Royal Navy was
mainly dependent for its efficiency upon the commercial
marine, and the classes of the community
connected therewith. This Bill, he urged, by discouraging
the employment of British shipbuilders,
ships, and seamen, tended directly to the reduction
of the commercial marine, and, thereby, to the diminution
of that naval strength which was the main
foundation of the greatness of this country, and the
surest defence of its independence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Royal
assent

June 26.</div>

<p>But all remonstrances, denunciations, petitions,
and protests were disregarded. The Bill passed the
House of Lords on the 12th June; and, although a
petition from the Shipowners<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> was presented to the
Queen by Sir George Grey praying her Majesty to
withhold her approval of the Bill, the Royal assent
was given on the 26th of that month, and thus the
Navigation Laws of Great Britain, which had endured
practically unchallenged during two centuries,
were almost utterly abrogated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Coasting

<p>It may be convenient here to dispose of the
question of the Coasting clauses, which it will be
remembered were withdrawn from the Bill of 1849.
Notwithstanding the opposition brought to bear
against this portion of the measure, and the continued
reluctance of foreign Powers to reciprocate,
the Coasting trade of the kingdom was, in 1854, unconditionally
thrown open to vessels of all nations
without any opposition from our Shipowners, indeed,
some of them then expressed deep regret that this
trade had not been opened to foreign shipping in
1849.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Americans,

<p>The actual repeal of the Navigation Laws having,
in the summer of 1849, become an accomplished fact,
the consternation among all classes connected with
British shipping was almost universal, mingled with
feelings of curiosity and doubt as to the course which
the Americans would now adopt. These doubts were,
however, soon removed by a prompt notification of the
Government of the United States,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> issued on the 15th
October, 1849, honestly and boldly putting the law
of 1828 in motion, but <i>retaining the coasting trade of
that country in all its integrity</i>; and, to this day they
decline, on alleged constitutional grounds, to consider
the voyage from New York to California as
in any respect different from the voyage between
New York and Baltimore, or as in any way resembling
the trade between London and the Cape
of Good Hope or Australia, though, in both cases
alike, the voyage can only be made by passing the
coasts of foreign nations!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Despondency
of
many
shipowners
after the
repeal of
the Navigation
Laws.</div>

<p>Considering the violent opposition offered by the
great majority of shipowners to the repeal of the
Navigation Laws, it is not surprising that their despondency,
when the Act came into operation, knew
no bounds. Many of them resolved—and a few acted
upon the resolution—to dispose of their ships at
whatever price they would fetch, others determined
to register them under a foreign flag; but few, if
any, carried out their determination in this respect.
On the other hand, as might have been expected,
foreign nations, and especially the United States,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
made extraordinary efforts to secure for their shipowners
the more valuable portion of the trade
thrown open by the repeal of these laws. Hitherto
the vessels of that country had more than rivalled
British ships in the China trade; and, ever since the
first Chinese war in 1842, when great expectations
were entertained of an enormous increase of trade
with that country, the Americans had made very
considerable efforts to secure the larger proportion
of it. To meet these efforts we had, before we were
roused from our apathy by the repeal of the Navigation
Laws, built various vessels of an improved
description, such as the <i>Alexander Baring</i>, <i>John
o’Gaunt</i>, <i>Euphrates</i>, <i>Monarch</i>, and <i>Foam</i>, which were
equal to any American vessels then engaged in the
trade with China. But, in 1845, various vessels were
despatched from New York and Boston to Wampoa,
of a novel form, which surpassed ours in speed,
having low hulls, great beam, very fine lines, and
with yards so square as to spread a far larger amount
of canvas in proportion to their tonnage than any
vessels hitherto afloat. To rival these we, in 1846,
first directed our attention to the construction of
“clipper vessels,” and as a test of these, Messrs.
Alexander Hall and Co. of Aberdeen, sent forth a
schooner named the <i>Torrington</i>, to compete with the
Americans then engaged in the coasting trade of
China, and in the still more lucrative opium trade.
As this vessel proved a success, others of greater
dimensions soon followed.</p>

<p>But in 1848, the Americans had found out a trade
exclusively their own, which led to the construction
of larger and still faster vessels than any they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
hitherto employed in the trade with China. The discovery
of the gold mines in California gave an impetus
to their shipbuilding hitherto unknown; and,
for that trade, they brought out a class of ships such
as the world had then never seen; their dimensions
in tonnage being as great as the largest of our old
East Indiamen, with a capacity for cargo far greater,
and with lines as sharp and fine as almost any Baltimore
clipper. The voyage of the first of these celebrated
vessels was limited to San Francisco, from
which she returned in ballast to New York, having
earned sufficient freight on her outward passage
alone to amply remunerate her enterprising owners.
The others, however, which followed, continued their
voyage from California to China, and having the
peculiar advantage of their own “coasting trade,”
from which the vessels of all other nations were
excluded, they obtained an immense advantage over
all competitors.</p>

<p>Freights from New York to California, which, at
first, were exorbitantly high, still averaged somewhere
about 5<i>l.</i> per ton: thence, these ships proceeded
to China, and there, were able to load cargoes of tea
and other produce direct for London or New York,
thus securing on the round voyage from 8<i>l.</i> to 10<i>l.</i>
per ton freight, while our ships, engaged in the
direct trade between London and China, a voyage
nearly as long, could only earn out and home little
more than half that rate per ton. It was not therefore,
surprising, that loud complaints were made by
British Shipowners of the disadvantage in which
their vessels were placed, when competing with those
of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Advantage
naturally
taken by
foreigners,
and especially
by
the Americans.</div>

<p>Encouraged by this special advantage, the Americans
constructed for the California and China trades,
vessels of still greater dimensions, and of a still finer
description, in which, for a time, they practically
monopolised not merely the trade between New York
and San Francisco, but also that between China and
Great Britain. Attributing the depression from
which they were suffering to the repeal of the Navigation
Laws, as every branch of trade was then
greatly depressed, our Shipowners naturally viewed,
with great alarm, the rapid strides made by American
shipping. Nor were their fears allayed by a
reference to the Board of Trade returns; wherein
it appeared that, while the increase of British
shipping had, in the year previously to the repeal
been 393,955 tons, there had been a decrease in the
year after the repeal of 180,576 tons; while, concurrently
with the falling off of British shipping, it was
also shown that foreign vessels, entering inwards
from foreign ports, had increased from 75,278 tons
to 364,587 tons. Our position appeared, therefore,
critical; and, had it not been for the resources we
held within ourselves, and the indomitable energy of
our people, foreign shipping might then have gained
an ascendency which might not afterwards have been
easily overcome.</p>

<p>American shipping, above that of all other
nations, had, hitherto, been moving onward with
such rapid strides that though, in 1815, at the close
of the war, the tonnage of the United States was not
more than one-half that of Great Britain, it had
risen by 1850 to 3,535,454 tons (including river and
lake steamers), against 4,232,960 tons of British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
shipping, and bade fair, with the special advantages
they now possessed, to surpass it in amount ere many
years had elapsed. Under such circumstances, unusual
efforts were necessary to maintain our position
as the first of maritime nations.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> We had, however,
one advantage which our great American competitors
did not possess. We had iron in abundance; and,
about this period, we were specially directing our
attention to the construction of iron ships to be
propelled by the screw.</p>

<p>Various of these vessels, to which I shall hereafter
fully refer, were launched about the year 1850, and
placed in competition with the American liners,
which had long, all but monopolised the trade between
the United States and Europe. Even if we
could not build wooden ships, as was then feared, at
as low a cost as the Americans, we had the advantage
in labour, in the cost of equipment, and in being
able to produce a superior class of vessels suited for the
China and other distant trades, from our English oak.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Jardine
and Co.

compete
with the
Americans.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Aberdeen
“clippers.”</div>

<p>There is, however, no doubt that at this period
there were few ships afloat which could rival in speed
the <i>Oriental</i>, <i>Challenge</i>, <i>Sea Witch</i>, <i>Flying Cloud</i>,
and various similar vessels the Americans had sent
forth to compete with us in the trade from China,
for, at that time, iron ships propelled by steam could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
not be profitably employed in so distant a trade. It
seemed almost hopeless<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> to expect that we could
construct sailing vessels which would enable us to
cope successfully with these celebrated ships. But,
though great in speed, it was soon discovered that
they were inferior in strength; and, as some of them
had landed their cargoes in a damaged state, the
shippers of tea and other valuable produce from China
encouraged the building of vessels of superior strength,
hoping, at the same time, to obtain by improved
models an increased speed, even if this speed did not
surpass that of these famous American vessels. Accordingly,
Messrs. Jardine, Matheson and Co. commissioned
Messrs. Hall and Co., of Aberdeen, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>construct for them a ship, with lines as sharp as
those of any American, but of superior strength.
The <i>Stornoway</i>, commanded by Captain Robinson,
formerly of the <i>John of Gaunt</i>, was the first of the
“Aberdeen clippers.” The <i>Chrysolite</i>, commanded
by Captain Enright, followed. But, though these
vessels proved very fast for their size, they were
still no match for the Americans, which were double
their dimensions. However, the <i>Cairngorm</i>, also built
by Hall for Messrs. Jardine, proved equal in speed
to any of her foreign competitors, and, by delivering
her cargo in superior order, obtained a preference.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until 1856, when the <i>Lord of
the Isles</i>, built by Scott, of Greenock, and commanded
by Captain Maxton, in a celebrated race for the
first delivery of the new teas from Foo-choo-foo in
London, beat two of the fastest American clippers,
though of nearly double her tonnage, delivering her
cargo without one spot of damage, that British ships
regained their ascendency in a trade which their
American rivals bade fair to monopolise. From
that time, British sailing ships, as I shall hereafter
show, gradually gained a complete ascendency over
the Americans in the China trade, and carried all
before them, until they, in turn, were supplanted by
British screw-steamers.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, our Shipowners were
suffering heavy losses in the ordinary branches of
commerce, with little prospect of any permanent
improvement. It was, therefore, not surprising that
many of them contemplated abandoning the business
in which they, as well as their forefathers for many
generations, had been engaged. To obtain a restoration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
of Protection was out of the question; while any
remission of burdens, or abrogation of restrictions,
in the power of the Legislature to grant, would not,
they felt, enable them to compete successfully with
their foreign rivals. To these burdens I shall hereafter
refer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shipowners
demand
the
enforcement
on
foreign nations
of
reciprocity.</div>

<p>As regarded non-reciprocity on the part of foreign
nations, they had little expectation that any relief
could be obtained. Every State that had anything
worth acceptance in the way of reciprocation had,
they were convinced, determined on adhering to a
Protective policy; and, though the retaliatory clause in
the Navigation Act might afford some power of compulsion,
the Shipowners saw from the discussions in
Parliament that it was vain to hope that such powers
would ever actually be put in force. Nevertheless,
under such gloomy political prospects, every effort
was made by the central body of the Shipowners’
Association in London to impress their views upon
the representatives of the maritime towns in Parliament.
The outports were urged to secure the return
of members who would support a policy opposed to
that of the indiscriminate abolition of all Protective
laws. The feeling thus provoked exercised its influence
during many succeeding years. They who
had the moral courage to advocate more enlightened
principles were made the victims of the exasperated
Shipowners, and a good many members lost their
seats at the general election of 1852 because they
could not, conscientiously, support any measure restoring
Protection to the Shipowners, even in the
modified form they now desired, the general enforcement
of the reciprocity on other nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Return of
prosperity
to the
Shipowners.</div>

<p>Happily, however, for the Shipowners, the demand
for their vessels soon rose; and, though some of them
may have severely suffered for the first twelve months
after the repeal of the Navigation Laws, they
soon recovered their losses, and their course ever
since has been, apart from the usual fluctuations in
all branches of commerce, one of almost continued
prosperity. Mr. Thomas Tooke, in his well-known
work,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> speaking of the annual state of trade at the
close of 1853, states, that the most satisfactory accounts
of the year’s business were those connected
with shipping. Indeed, 1852, as well as 1853, were
years of prosperity to every class of persons connected
with ships.</p>

<p>The enormous emigration of the former year, and
the great increase of imports and exports in 1853—caused
unquestionably by our liberal policy—created
a sudden demand for freight, far beyond
the resources of vessels really available. British
ships of the highest class rose in price from 15<i>l.</i> to
21<i>l.</i> and 22<i>l.</i> per ton, and colonial from 6<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> to
11<i>l.</i> per ton; freights, in many instances, advanced
more than 100 per cent.; and it was soon discovered
that, though the carrying trade of England
had been opened to vessels of all nations, English
merchants could not find sufficient tonnage to supply
the orders pouring in on them from every part of the
world: thus, while the demand for Australia was still
on the increase, new branches of commerce were
opening out also in other quarters. Freights from
Odessa rose from 65<i>s.</i> to 120<i>s.</i> per ton; the rates to
and from the west coast of South America, Brazil, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>the West Indies were nearly doubled; from America,
both in timber and grain, freights advanced in like
proportion, as well as in the Baltic; and, even, in the
coal trade between Newcastle and London, the usual
standard rate of 6<i>s.</i> per ton was more than doubled.
The grain trade, beyond all others, was characterised
by extraordinary activity, the result of events it was
impossible to foresee; while the practical closing of
some of the most important granaries during the subsequent
war between Russia and Turkey, greatly
enhanced the price of corn, and gave rise to large
importations of bread-stuffs from the United States
and other more distant parts of the world, necessitating,
at the same time, a large amount of tonnage
for their transport. The surprising prosperity, which
had so suddenly succeeded a period of depression and
adversity, silenced for a time, though it did not extinguish,
the complaints of the already “old school”
Shipowners against the repeal of the Navigation
Laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Act of
1850, for
the improvement
of the condition
of
seamen.</div>

<p>But, as British ships were now subjected to the
competition of the vessels of all nations, Government
considered it their duty to afford every facility
as far as regards education and the means of
obtaining it to the men by whom they were
manned, holding that they were bound to secure for
them every advantage in this respect possessed by
those of foreign nations. We have seen, by the
reports from the various Consuls abroad and from
other sources, that, in the training of our seamen
for the work they have to do, we were far behind
our foreign competitors. Consequently, among the
earliest measures of 1850, an Act was passed which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
had for its object the improvement of the existing
condition of our seafaring population, especially as
regards commanders and officers, and for affording
to Shipowners greater facilities than they had
hitherto possessed for engaging and regulating the
conduct of the crews of their ships. Hitherto, though
our ships had been, by some people, pompously, styled
the “harbingers of peace, Christianity, and civilisation,”
they had more frequently carried with them
to other lands vices previously unknown there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Valuable
services of
Mr. T. H.
Farrer.</div>

<p>In point of fact, all other nations, except England,
had a code of laws to regulate the conduct and test
the competency of those who navigated their merchant
ships; life and property with us being placed
under the charge of men without any security for
their conduct, integrity, or ability. Avaricious Shipowners,
too, often bought labour in the cheapest,
and rarely, therefore, in the best market; while
others, with sons and brothers to provide for, placed
them in charge of their ships, or in other responsible
positions, for which they were often altogether
incompetent. The seamen, themselves, were neglected,
and, in many instances, were, to a great
extent, under the control of a class of nefarious
persons known as “crimps,” who procured them employment,
discounted their advance notes at usurious
rates, and, too frequently, plundered them of all they
possessed at the termination of the voyage. It,
therefore, became the duty of Government to do what
in them lay to remedy these glaring evils. Happily
there had just been appointed, as Secretary to the
new Marine Department of the Board of Trade, a
young gentleman of rare abilities, who had devoted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
considerable attention to the state of our mercantile
marine, and had accepted this office with a fixed determination
to remedy, as far as legislation could do,
the existing evils. To Mr. T. H. Farrer the country
is greatly indebted for most of the measures which
have since been passed in connection with our mercantile
marine.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Chief conditions
of
the Act of
1850.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Certificates
of
examination.</div>

<p>The first of these reform Acts, entitled, “An Act
for Improving the Condition of Masters, Mates, and
Seamen, and Maintaining Discipline in the Merchant
Service,” received the Royal assent on the
14th August, 1850, and came into operation on the
1st January of the following year. This Act contains
124 clauses, and places under the Board of
Trade the general superintendence of matters relating
to the British mercantile marine, with power to
carry the Act into execution in all its details. This
valuable measure provides for the establishment of
local marine boards at the principal seaports in the
kingdom. These boards consist of from six to twelve
members, comprised of the Mayor or the stipendiary
magistrate resident in the district, of two to four
members nominated by the Board of Trade, the
remainder being elected by the shipowners resident
in the place. Two superior officers with various
subordinates were appointed to carry out the duties of
the marine board under the direction of its members.
The first and most important of these duties consisted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>in the examination of persons intending to become
masters or mates of foreign-going ships, who are
now required to give satisfactory evidence of their
sobriety, experience, ability, and general good conduct,
before they are entitled to receive a certificate
of their competency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appointment
of
local marine
boards,</div>

<div class="sidenote">and their
duties.</div>

<p>Those persons who had previously been in command
of ships, or who had served as mates, were not
required to undergo an examination, but received
a certificate of service, enabling them to accept appointments
similar to those they had held previously
to the Act coming into operation; so that, in this
respect, the law was not retrospective, but only required
such persons to undergo examination who had
not before acted in the above capacities; power was,
at the same time, given to the board to cancel their
certificates of service, or of competency, provided
those who held them were guilty of misconduct, or
otherwise found to be unfit for their duties. Penalties
were inflicted for false representations, for forging,
or altering, or fraudulently using their certificates.
The local marine boards were required to establish
shipping offices, where all seamen are engaged; and
to appoint, subject to the approval of the Board of
Trade, shipping-masters, whose duties were to ascertain
that engagements were made in proper form, to
issue the advance notes of the seamen, and to see
that they joined the ships for which they had engaged
at the time fixed for departure. Their duties, likewise,
extended to the settlement of the seamen’s wages at
the termination of the voyage, and to the seeing that
while the men were justly dealt with, they received,
also, a proper discharge. They were, moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
bound to keep a register of the names and character
of the seamen and apprentices, and to perform such
duties, in relation to the indentures of the latter, as
had previously been performed by the officers of
Customs. All agreements were to be in a specified
form, and to state, as far as practicable, the nature
and length of the voyage on which the ship is to be
employed, the time when each seaman was to commence
duty, the capacity in which he was engaged
to serve, the amount of wages he was to receive, the
scale of the provisions to be supplied, with such
further regulations as might be necessary for his
conduct on board, and to inflict fines, short allowance
of provisions, or other lawful punishments for misconduct.
These agreements the shipping master is
required to read over to the seamen, who, if they
approve, then sign them in his presence. No alterations
are allowed to be made, unless with the consent
of all parties; and these agreements must be
produced by the master, before a clearance of the
ship can be obtained at the Customs. Similar agreements
are required for vessels engaged in the coasting
trade; but, in this case, they need only be entered
into once in six months, and may be signed either
on board the vessel or at the shipping office. Penalties
are inflicted on masters for taking seamen to
sea without such agreement, or for its non-production
if required by the British Consul abroad, or by
the shipping master, or Collector of Customs in the
ports of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The masters and officers are examined in seamanship
in its varied branches, as well as in navigation;
and the course of examination very much resembles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
what, as I have already described, has long been
adopted in various foreign countries. It is of two
grades—first and second class—and has produced
the most marked effect in the moral, social, and intellectual
improvement of the persons in charge of
the vessels of our now gigantic mercantile marine.
However much our ships have improved, in all respects,
since the Navigation Laws were repealed, and
this improvement has been very remarkable, it is
not greater than what has taken place in the case
of the men by whom they are commanded and navigated.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of this Act every consideration
seems to have been given to the wants of the
seamen, with the exception of their education, provision
being made for the proper payment of their
wages and advance notes, and further facilities
afforded for their more prompt recovery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
provisions
of the Act
of 1850.</div>

<p>This Act further provides, that, in every ship, nine
superficial feet of space, measured upon the deck,
is to be appropriated to each seaman, either in the
forecastle or in a suitable house on deck; such space
to be kept entirely free of stores of every kind, to
be securely and properly constructed, and to be well
ventilated. The owner is also bound to provide, for
the use of all on board, a supply of medicines, in
accordance with a scale sanctioned by Government;
with lime-juice in certain cases, and fresh vegetables
whenever they can be conveniently obtained: the
masters, also, of all ships are bound to keep weights
and measures on board, so that the seaman may be
satisfied that he has his full allowance of provision
agreeably with the Act; while heavy penalties are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
inflicted on owners who do not conform to these
conditions.</p>

<p>In the case of desertion, the masters or owners are
authorized by this Act to give or take in charge,
without warrant, any seaman who had left his ship
without “leave,” or any seaman or apprentice who
neglects or refuses to join a ship in which he has
engaged to serve. Though this clause has since
been frequently condemned, and might be limited
with advantage to within a certain time before the
ship sails, it was absolutely necessary to deal with such
cases promptly, for deserting seamen, more especially
when in debt to the ship, readily found employment,
and would, in many cases, have sailed in other vessels
before it was possible to have obtained a formal
warrant for their apprehension.</p>

<p>Any misconduct endangering the ship, or life or
limb, is considered a misdemeanour; as also any wilful
breach of duty, by reason of drunkenness or
any other cause, which might tend to the immediate
loss, destruction, or serious damage of the ship, or
of the life or limbs of any persons, engaged in her.
Certain offences may be summarily punished on
arrival in port, such as wilfully damaging the ship,
or embezzling or wilfully damaging any of her stores
or cargo, assaulting the master or mate, wilful disobedience
to lawful commands, or combining with
any other or others of the crew to disobey these
commands, neglect duty, or with impeding the navigation
of the ship or the progress of the voyage.
All such matters may be summarily dealt with, by
inflicting punishment of from one to three months’
confinement with or without hard labour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Institution
of Naval
Courts
abroad.</div>

<p>Naval Courts are also instituted abroad, for hearing
complaints with regard to either seamen or masters,
and for dealing with them in a summary manner.
These courts are constituted of from three to five
members, and consist of officers of her Majesty’s Navy,
of rank not below that of lieutenant, of a consular
officer, and of the master of a British ship; but, if
there should happen to be no ships-of-war in the
harbour, the Consul has power to nominate any other
disinterested master or merchant to act as a member
of such court.</p>

<p>Among the more important sections of the Act,
I must not omit that referring to the clause enjoining
masters of ships to keep a log-book of a prescribed
form, known as the “official log.” In this book the
master is ordered to enter, not merely the daily course
and position of the ship, but all occurrences on
board as to the conduct of the crew; any disobedience
of orders or neglect of duty; an entry is further
required to be made of the death, injury, or illness
of any seaman and of the time when he left the
ship, should he have done so without leave. This
official log the master has to deliver, on his return to
port, to the Collector of Customs before an entry of
his ship can be obtained; and in the case of any ship
being sold abroad, the master or transferrer thereof
must deliver or transmit it, duly made up to the
time of transfer, to the shipping master or Collector of
Customs, at the port to which the ship previously
belonged. Penalties of from 5<i>l.</i> to 20<i>l.</i> are inflicted
upon the master or owner for not keeping the log in
proper form, or for neglecting to make the necessary
entries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span></p>

<p>When a seaman is discharged from a vessel by
mutual consent, either abroad or at the termination
of the voyage, the master must give him a certificate
of character, in a form sanctioned by the Board of
Trade, specifying his qualifications; but in cases
where the seaman has proved incompetent or negligent
in his duty, the master may decline to give
him this certificate, so far as regards his character.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Special inspectors
to
be appointed
by
the Board
of Trade,
if need be.</div>

<p>Power is further taken by the Board of Trade
to institute a special investigation, wherever there is
reason to apprehend that any serious accident, occasioning
loss of life or property, has been sustained,
or that any of the provisions of the Act, or of any
other Act relating to merchant shipping or merchant
sailors, has been grossly neglected or disobeyed;
and, for that purpose, to appoint local inspectors or
any other competent persons, to inquire into and
report thereupon. These inspectors have power
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>to go on board and examine the ship and any
papers relating to the voyage, and may call for the
production of evidence; and penalties are inflicted
for obstructing any of them in the execution of this
duty. Various other clauses, for the protection alike
of the owner, master, and seamen, are to be found in
the Act, which extends to all British possessions at
home or abroad, including India. A schedule is
attached, regulating the scale of fees to be charged
for the examination of masters and mates, and for the
engagement and discharge of crews.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Act of
1851, regulating
Merchant
Seaman’s
Fund, &amp;c.</div>

<p>I have frequently, in the course of this work, had
occasion to refer to the Merchant Seaman’s Fund,
established by 20 Geo. II., cap. 38, as also by 4 &amp; 5
Will. IV., cap. 52, and by 6 Will. IV., cap. 15. As
this fund had been grossly mismanaged, an Act
was passed in 1851 (8th August) to provide for the
winding it up, and for its better management in
future. Consequently all the previous Acts relating
to it, together with various amending Acts, were
swept away, and the general supervision of the
business of winding-up the fund was placed in the
hands of the Board of Trade, or of such persons as
that Board might appoint. By the previous Act all
masters and mates of ships were required to subscribe
from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i>, and all seamen 1<i>s.</i> per
month toward the fund, of which 6<i>d.</i> went to
Greenwich Hospital. But the Act of 1851 rendered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>it no longer obligatory on their part to do so.
Those persons, however, who voluntarily continued
their subscriptions were to be entitled to pensions
in old age, or when otherwise rendered unfit for
their duties; and provision was, likewise, made for
the widows and children of such persons. These
subscriptions the shipping masters appointed under
the Mercantile Marine Act of 1850 are authorized
to receive, and all moneys and properties forming
part of, or belonging to, the Merchant Seaman’s
Fund are transferred to the Board of Trade. No
master or seaman who had not contributed to the
fund before the passing of this Act is allowed to
contribute thereto, or to establish any claim for
pension or other relief for himself, or for his wife or
children; so that the benefits to be derived are
confined, exclusively, to those who had hitherto subscribed,
and who voluntarily continued their subscriptions
after the passing of the Act of 1851; the
Commissioners of her Majesty’s Treasury are further
authorized to pay, out of the Consolidated Fund, such
sums as may be necessary, in addition to the voluntary
subscriptions, for the necessary expenditure, and
to make good the deficiency; they are also to pay to
this fund the unclaimed wages and effects of deceased
seamen; and all fines levied for neglect of duty or
otherwise are appropriated for the same purpose.</p>

<p>The Board of Trade is authorized to determine and
regulate the principles and conditions on which
relief is to be granted under the Act, and to make
such regulations and by-laws as may be necessary
for the receipt and distribution of the fund. The
Board has also to render annually to Parliament an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
account of the receipts and disbursements of the
previous year, under several heads; the amount of
money in hand, and any sums which may be
outstanding; the number of pensioners—distinguishing
between men, women, and children, and between
different scales of pensions, and the total amount
of pensions in each class, together with that of the
salaries and expenses of management.</p>

<p>But, beyond these Acts, a great deal more was
necessary for the proper government of the merchant
service. The vast multitude of Acts of Parliament
suspending, repealing, and altering parts of other
Acts had involved our commercial maritime law in
almost inextricable confusion, and had become most
injurious to the public interest. No persons but
those well conversant with the subject can imagine
to what extent this abuse had sometimes been
carried. When the Navigation Laws were repealed
no less than forty-eight separate and distinct Acts
of Parliament were in force relating directly to
maritime affairs; some of them, now before me, are
in black-letter type of a very ancient date. It,
therefore, became necessary to deal with these Acts;
and, for that and other still more important objects, a
Bill was introduced in 1854, which dealt in the most
comprehensive manner with all questions relating
to merchant ships and their crews. In this great
measure, the two Acts to which I have just referred
were embodied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Merchant
Shipping
Act, 1854.</div>

<p>The Merchant Shipping Act of 1854<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> contains no
less than five hundred and forty-eight clauses, divided
into eleven separate and distinct parts or sections.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>
<p>The first lays down the general functions of
the Board of Trade; the second relates to the ownership,
registration, and measurement of British ships;
and the third is confined, exclusively, to matters
referring to the conduct and duties of masters and
seamen, and embraces the whole of the conditions of
the Act of 1850, with various additions and amendments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New
measurement
of
ships.</div>

<p>The measurement of ships embodied in part
second of this Act is a great improvement on all
former modes of ascertaining the tonnage of a ship,
as it takes capacity for its basis; and thus, while
proportioning the dues payable by ships to their
capabilities of carrying freight, affords free scope
to Shipowners to construct such vessels as are best
adapted to the trade in which they are to be employed.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
This admirable mode of admeasurement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>was also adopted, at a recent congress, as the basis
for ascertaining the tonnage on which ships of any
nation were to pay dues on passing through the
Suez Canal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Registration
of
ships.</div>

<p>In dealing with the question of registration, the
second portion of the Act of 1854, which contains
ninety-one clauses, while it specifies in detail what
persons are qualified to become owners of British merchant
ships, likewise points out in what proportion of
ownership the vessel may be held, inflicts penalties
for non-attendance to these rules, and on builders for
issuing false certificates. It also requires all change
of owners or masters to be endorsed on the register;
specifies the condition on which new certificates may
be issued, and how they are to be disposed of in the
event of shipwreck; the mode of transfer in case of
sale, death, or bankruptcy is likewise clearly defined;
as also the registration of all mortgages in their
priority of claim, the mortgagee having power of
sale without being held liable for any of the responsibilities
of ownership.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The
“Rule of
the Sea.”</div>

<p>The fourth part of the Act is almost as important
as the third, which deals, as we have seen, with the
qualifications and duties of masters, officers, and
seamen. It refers to the safety and prevention of
accidents, a subject which has created much controversy
of late, and to which reference will be made
more fully hereafter. This important section of the
Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 requires all sea-going
vessels to be provided with a certain number
of boats in proportion to their tonnage and the trade
in which they are engaged. It lays down rules as
to the meeting and passing of ships at sea, and the
use of lights and fog-signals—a regulation of daily
increasing importance and more completely carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
out in 1863, from the vast number of vessels now
traversing the ocean, and especially the English and
other great channels of commerce.</p>

<p>Various necessary and excellent regulations are
embodied for the construction and equipment of steam-ships,
without interfering with their form, leaving
their owners and builders every possible scope for
improvement, and compelling the fulfilment of certain
conditions necessary to insure safety without relieving
their owners from their just responsibility to the
public. Vessels built of iron must be separated into
water-tight compartments, which has since been repealed,
and, in the case of steamers, the engine-room
must be kept entirely distinct from the hold and
cabins; passenger ships (of which further notice will
hereafter be taken) are under special regulations with
regard to surveys and signals, the use of fire-engines,
and the shelter of all persons conveyed on deck.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pilots and
pilotage.</div>

<p>In the fifth part, the powers and general jurisdiction
of pilots and pilotage authorities are defined.
Power is also given by this Act to dispense with the
use of pilots which had been enforced at certain
places, by the Acts of 1849 and 1853, and was subsequently
extended to all ports in the United Kingdom
except London, Liverpool, and Bristol, so as to permit
“the master or mate of any ship” who “may, upon
giving due notice, and consenting to pay the usual
expenses, apply to any pilotage authority to be examined
as to his capacity to pilot the ship of which
he is master or mate, or any one or more ships belonging
to the same owners,” and, if found qualified,
to receive a pilotage certificate.</p>

<p>The sixth part of the Act refers to the management<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
of lighthouses,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> buoys, and beacons, whether
under the immediate control of the Ancient Trinity
House of Deptford Strond, of the “Commissioners of
the Northern Lighthouses,” or of the Dublin “Ballast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
Board.”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> These separate authorities (subject to
the control of the Board of Trade) are hereby authorized
to appoint persons to inspect the lighthouses
and levy dues for their maintenance (but with revision
by her Majesty in Council), and to regulate
and alter such dues. Accordingly, each of them
may see the following works carried out within its
jurisdiction:—(1) Erect, remove, alter, or repair
lighthouses, with all other requisite works in connection
with them; (2) construct, place, or alter any
buoys or beacons; (3) purchase any land necessary
either for the lighthouse or its approaches, with residences
for the light-keepers; and (4) vary the character
of any lighthouse or the mode of exhibiting
any lights therein.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Existing
Mercantile
Marine
Fund.</div>

<p>The seventh part deals with the existing Mercantile
Marine Fund, which, in some respects, but only
to the very limited extent I have named, supplies the
place of the Merchant Seaman’s Fund, and directs
the Board of Trade to carry to this fund all fees and
other sums received under the provisions of the third
and fourth sections of this Act; all surplus light dues,
when not appropriated to the reduction of the charge
levied on ships, all rates and moneys received by
the Trinity House under the Local Act (7 Vict.,
cap. 57) for the regulation of lastage and ballastage
in the River Thames, and various other fees. It
directs these funds to be applied to the cost of the
examinations, and of the shipping offices provided
under the third part, and of the survey of steam
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>ships under the fourth part of this Act. The remaining
portions of this fund not required for the
maintenance of the lighthouses, &amp;c., &amp;c., is used for
the purpose of establishing and maintaining on the
coast of the United Kingdom proper life-boats,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>for rewarding the preservation of life in such cases as
the Board of Trade may direct, and for remunerating
persons in connection with wrecks, casualties, and
salvage with which the eighth portion of the Act
specially deals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wrecks.</div>

<p>The inquiry into wrecks, though still requiring
amendment, is not the least important part of the
Merchant Shipping Act of 1854. It has proved of
immense value to the State, and combined with the
new law of admeasurement, and, of course, with that
wholesome rivalry free navigation has created, has
done much to improve the quality and equipment of
the merchant vessels of Great Britain, and has, at the
same time, tended to the safety of life and property
at sea. This part of the Act provides, that whenever
any ship is lost, abandoned, or materially
damaged, especially in cases where life has been
sacrificed, the Board of Trade <i>may</i><a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> institute an inquiry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>(I object to the mode in which this is now carried
out) into the cause of such misfortune, and, for
this purpose, appoint suitable persons to form a court,
able and competent to deal with all such questions.</p>

<p>Under the eighth part of the Act, the Board of
Trade has intrusted to it the general superintendence
of all matters relating to wrecks cast on shore, together
with the appointment of receivers, who have
authority to summon all persons, promiscuously, to
their aid, to whatever number may be deemed necessary
for the saving from plunder or otherwise the
property thus stranded, and to “demand the use of
any waggon, cart, or horses that may be near at
hand;” “all persons refusing, without reasonable
cause, to comply with this summons are liable to
a penalty not exceeding 100<i>l.</i>” The receiver can also
use force to suppress plunder, and “if any person
is killed, maimed, or otherwise hurt by reason of his
resisting the receiver in the execution of his duties,
this officer is indemnified against all prosecutions for
such acts”—a power somewhat approaching the
rigour of the ancient laws, but still not too stringent
to suppress the lawlessness even now prevailing when
wrecks take place on remote parts of our coasts.
Certain rules are laid down to be observed by persons
finding or taking possession of a wreck; for
instance, he must give notice of it as soon as possible
to the receiver of the district, and, if he fails to do
so, is, thereby, subject to penalties for his neglect, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
well as to the loss of all salvage. Salvage is awarded
to persons saving life or property from the perils of
the sea, and is regulated in amount by the risk incurred
and the extent of services rendered, the saving
of life having priority over all other claims.</p>

<p>Provision is, generously and very properly, now
made, that no claim for the use of any of her
Majesty’s ships in saving life or property shall be
valid, and that no person on board of such ships
shall be permitted to make any demand on this behalf
without the formal consent of the Admiralty, the
mode of procedure in all such cases, previously in
many ways objectionable, is now clearly established
and defined. Nor does the Act omit to deal, and
with great propriety, with dealers in marine stores
and manufacturers of anchors. Subsequently, but on
much more debateable grounds,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> an act was passed
which dealt with the makers of chain cables.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Limitation
of the
liability of
shipowners.</div>

<p>The ninth part of the Merchant Shipping Act
defines or limits the liability of shipowners under
certain circumstances; that is to say, shipowners are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>not liable, so far as regards fire, loss of life or personal
injury, or loss of goods or merchandise, unless
they have rendered themselves personally responsible,
“to an extent beyond the value of their ship,
and the freight due or to grow due in respect of
such ship during the voyage.” This liability was
further limited in 1862 by Mr. Milner Gibson when
President of the Board of Trade.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The mode of
procedure is laid down at length and with great
perspicuity; but nothing in the Act is “to lessen
or take away any liability to which any master or
seaman, being also owner or part owner of the ship
to which he belongs, is subject in his capacity of
master or seaman.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Various
miscellaneous
provisions.</div>

<p>The tenth part of the Act refers to the mode of
legal procedure “in all cases where no particular
country is mentioned within her Majesty’s dominions;”
while the eleventh and last part deals with
a few miscellaneous subjects, such as granting power
to masters or owners of ships to enter into contracts,
under certain circumstances, with Lascars
or other natives of India for voyages to Great
Britain, Australia, or other parts of her Majesty’s
dominions: to corporations for the granting of sites
for the erection of sailors’ homes: to the legislative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>authority of any British possession for the repeal,
alteration or amendment of any provisions of the
Act “relating to ships registered in such possession:”
and to the Commissioners of Customs to recover from
the Consolidated Fund, or from the Mercantile Marine
Fund, all expenses incurred by them in the conduct
of suits or prosecutions raised under the Act.</p>

<p>Such are the leading provisions of the Merchant
Shipping Act of 1854, one of the greatest, most
useful, and salutary measures ever passed, the repeal
of the Navigation Laws excepted, in connection with
the mercantile marine of Great Britain.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Act of
1855.</div>

<p>In the following year (1855) an Act, which may
be taken as part of the great Act of 1854, was
passed to facilitate the erection and maintenance of
colonial lighthouses; to amend some of the clauses
referring to light dues; to specify more distinctly the
conditions of ownership and the nature of mortgages;
and to exempt the owners of pleasure yachts
from having their names and the port to which they
belong painted on the stern, as in the case of merchant
vessels. Additional powers were also given
by this Act to naval courts abroad, in the case of
misconduct of the master or crew: for the relief of
destitute Lascars, and for other matters of minor
importance.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132" class="label">[132]</a> At that moment our prospects were certainly very gloomy, and it
was not surprising that many of our shipowners were disposing of their
property. On the other hand, as most of our shipbuilders were idle, it
was a favourable moment to contract for the construction of ships. I,
therefore, embraced the opportunity, and contracted in one week for six
ships of an improved description, of about 1000 tons each. Two of
these I built at Sunderland, two at Maryport, one in Dundee, and
one in Jersey. Most of the old school of shipowners thought I had lost
my senses, and prophesied “ruin;” but others thought there was
“method in my madness,” and were thus encouraged to follow my
example. Many of my readers may remember the jeering paragraphs
which appeared in the Free-trade journals of the period, headed
“Lindsay and more ruin,” “Not so bad as they seem,” and so forth.
But the fact had an astonishing effect in rousing our shipowners from
their dreams of despair, and I never had any reason to regret my
“daring speculation.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_133" href="#FNanchor_133" class="label">[133]</a> Mr. T. C. Cowper, of Aberdeen, himself a member of a well-known
shipbuilding firm in Aberdeen, who had spent some time in China at
the period to which I now refer, and to whom I am indebted for much
of the information connected with our struggles to maintain our
position in that trade, gives the following graphic description of his
voyage home in the <i>Ganges</i>, Captain Deas, belonging to Leith, one of
the vessels we had sent forth soon after the repeal of our Navigation
Laws, to compete with the Americans in that trade. “We landed,” he
says, “new teas at Wampoa, and sailed on the 1st September, 1851.
Two of the fastest American clippers, the <i>Flying Cloud</i> and <i>Bald Eagle</i>,
sailed two or three days after us. A great deal of excitement existed
in China about the race, the American ships being the favourites.
The South-west monsoon being strong, the <i>Ganges</i> made a rather long
passage to Anger, but when we arrived there we found that neither of
our rivals had been reported as having passed. We arrived in the
English Channel on the evening of the 16th of December. On the
following morning at daylight we were off Portland, well in shore and
under short sail, light winds from north-east, and weather rather thick.
About 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the wind freshened and the haze cleared away, which
showed two large and lofty ships two or three miles to windward of us.
They proved to be our American friends, having their stripes and stars
flying for a pilot. Captain Deas at once gave orders to hoist his signals
for a pilot also, and as, by this time, several cutters were standing out
from Weymouth, the <i>Ganges</i> being farthest in shore got her pilot first
on board. I said that I would land in the pilot boat and go to London
by rail, and would report the ship that night or next morning at
Austin Friars.” (She was consigned to my firm.) “The breeze had
considerably freshened before I got on board the pilot cutter, when the
<i>Ganges</i> filled away on the port tack, and, contrary to his wont, for he
was a very cautious man, crowded on all small sails. The Americans
lost no time and were after him, and I had three hours’ view of as fine
an ocean race as I can wish to see; the wind being dead ahead, the
ships were making short tacks. The <i>Ganges</i> showed herself to be the
most weatherly of the three; and the gain on every tack in shore was
obvious, neither did she seem to carry way behind in fore reaching.
She arrived off Dungeness six hours before the other two, and was in
the London Docks twenty-four hours before the first, and thirty-six
hours before the last, of her opponents.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_134" href="#FNanchor_134" class="label">[134]</a> All our shipowners had not, however, even then given way to
despair, and Mr. Farrer reminds me of a speech which, at the time,
had a considerable effect in rousing the drooping spirits of those who
were in doubt. He says, in a note I received from him the other day:
“Shortly after I joined the Board of Trade, in 1850, I went to dine at
some large dinner in the City (a dinner, I think, for one of the great
marine charities) at which a great number of the large London shipowners
were present. They were then in a state of great irritation at
the recent repeal of the Navigation Laws. Amongst those present was
the late Mr. Richard Green, who, as is well known, was one of the very
few shipowners who supported the Government on the repeal of these
laws. After dinner the usual speeches were made, and amongst them
was one by the Secretary to the American Legation, a young gentleman
who addressed us in the flowing style not uncommon with
young Transatlantic orators. After him came Mr. Richard Green—the
contrast of style was striking. ‘We have heard,’ he said, ‘a good
deal to-night about the dismal prospects of British shipping, and we
hear, too, from another quarter, a great deal about the British Lion
and the American Eagle, and the way in which they are going to lie
down together. Now, I don’t know anything about all that, but this I
do know, that we, the British shipowners, have at last sat down to
play a fair and open game with the Americans, and by Jove we will
trump them!’ The feelings of the other shipowners present may be
conceived.” And I may add he <i>did</i> “trump them,” for shortly afterwards
he built a ship called the <i>Challenger</i> to match their <i>Challenge</i>,
which thoroughly eclipsed her.</p>

1850, when he was employed by the late Lord Taunton, then Mr.
Labouchere, to draw up a Merchant Shipping Bill; and he has ever
since had important relations with that Board, more especially on all
matters connected with the Mercantile Marine, first, as Secretary to
that department, and now as permanent Chief Secretary to the Board.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_137" href="#FNanchor_137" class="label">[137]</a> Perhaps if masters of ships were more particular, and instead
of inserting in the printed certificate of discharge, as they now almost
indiscriminately do, “V. G.” (very good), they would mark the real
character of the man, with “V. G.” or “G.” as the case might be, or
when necessary substitute “N. S.” (not satisfied), it might have some
effect in improving the character of seamen; and these documents,
which are now almost worthless, would then become of some service to
shipmasters themselves. Why should we not adopt the course which
we generally (but not always) do in the case of house servants? A
house servant without a character has not much chance of employment,
even now, when the demand is very great for them. To give a
true and just character is a duty we owe, not merely to ourselves, but
to society, and shipmasters should understand that, by granting a
certificate of “V. G.” or “G.,” when the character of the seaman does
not deserve either grade, may produce far more serious consequences
on board ship than would likely be the case in our households, where
we can discharge a bad servant at once, which we have no power to
do at sea. One bad seaman may not merely contaminate the whole crew,
but may be the means of the loss of the ship on which he sails, and of
all on board.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_138" href="#FNanchor_138" class="label">[138]</a> This portion of the Act was somewhat hastily framed, especially as
regards the extent of inquiry and the power of depriving masters and
officers of their certificates; and, although that power was subsequently
limited by the Acts of 1854 and 1862, the clauses referring to the mode
of inquiry and the power to punish might with advantage be still materially
modified.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_139" href="#FNanchor_139" class="label">[139]</a> 17 &amp; 18 Vict., cap. 84.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_140" href="#FNanchor_140" class="label">[140]</a> The rule is to measure the length of the ship in a straight line
along the deck, deducting from the length what is due to the rake of
the bow, as also to the stern timber, and to divide the length thus taken
into from four to twelve equal parts, according to the size of the ship.
At each of these divisions the breadth is taken and the depth at each
point of the division, and by making certain allowances, which the Act
specifies in minute detail, the capacity of each section or compartment
is thus accurately obtained. When the products of these are ascertained,
the register tonnage is obtained by means of an easy mode of
calculation, alike applicable, and equitably applicable, I must add, to
ships of any size and every conceivable form. Of course this tonnage
is subject to additions or deductions (which have sometimes been the
cause of much controversy) for poops, top-gallant forecastles, houses,
and other enclosed spaces on deck, which are all additions to the tonnage,
while the large spaces occupied by engines, boilers, and coal-bunkers
in steamers are deductions from it. Altogether it would not
be easy to concoct a more just and wise mode of ascertaining the
register tonnage of merchant vessels than that which Mr. Moorson, a
man of remarkable genius, after years of labour, submitted for the consideration
of Government, and which, through the instrumentality of
Mr. Farrer, was in a great measure, adopted and embodied into the
Merchant Shipping Act of 1854. I look back, as one of the pleasing
reminiscences of my public life, to the hours I spent with Mr. Moorson
in going through the details of his scheme before it was submitted to
the public; but, though I may have ventured to offer an amendment
here and there, as others may have done, the merit of the scheme
belongs to him alone. It is now adopted by nearly all maritime
nations. Mr. Moorson was the most modest of men; and I have the
greatest pleasure in adding my humble testimony to the public labours
of this most excellent and unassuming man.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_141" href="#FNanchor_141" class="label">[141]</a> This Act has been a <i>real</i> success. A perfect title to any ship—even
to the <i>Great Eastern</i>—can now be obtained at the nominal expense of
only one shilling sterling! Why cannot we apply some such principle
to the sale and transfer of land? It may be vain to ask such a question;
but the reason may be explained by an anecdote: “When in Parliament
I was frequently required to accompany deputations from my
constituents, and other persons connected with shipping to the Board
of Trade. One occasion, when Mr. Henley was President to the
Board, I well remember. The deputation was from a great seaport
on the eastern coast, and its leading spokesman was an attorney of
considerable local influence and reputation. Among the various
grievances brought under the notice of Mr. Henley was one which I
did not expect to hear, and which has, certainly, never been conscientiously
raised either before or since. It related to the law of Ship
Registry as settled by the Act of 1854. One of the leading features
of that law is, that the Register shall contain nothing but the names
of those persons who can give an <i>absolute</i> title to the ship, omitting
altogether the trusts and ramifying interests which make the transfer
of a title to land such a complicated and expensive matter. The
attorney in question, however, attempted to make out the omission to
be a great grievance, arguing that all sorts of complicated interests
could not be placed on the Register. Mr. Henley, whose shrewdness
has now become proverbial (for I do not remember any man in the
House of Commons who more readily discovered the flaws in Bills
introduced for its consideration), in reply, after dealing with other
grievances, in his usual pointed and clear manner, quietly remarked,
‘And now we come to another grievance—that you cannot put trusts
on the Register. Now, it seems to me,’ he continued, ‘that we have
been tolerably successful in doing for ships what all the wise men are
trying <i>in vain</i> to do for land—that is, to save them from a long lawyer’s
bill—there <i>may</i> be a grievance—I dare say <i>some one</i> (looking hard at
the attorney) <i>has a grievance</i>, but I don’t think it is the <i>shipowner</i>!’”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_142" href="#FNanchor_142" class="label">[142]</a> In the Exhibition of 1851 the French exhibited some beautiful
specimens of coast-lights, in which they then excelled, but, since then,
(see papers read by Sir William Thompson and Mr. J. Hopkinson
before the British Association at Bristol) we have made remarkable
improvements in the forms of our lighthouse apparatus, and now
produce lights more powerful and brilliant than any other country.
These are, chiefly, manufactured by Messrs. Chance Brothers of Birmingham,
and, for the mode of arranging the glass reflectors, we are
greatly indebted to the genius of the late Professor Faraday and
Sir William Thompson. Lights are now constructed, which on a
clear night can be seen at a distance of twenty-five miles, perhaps
more. But still greater improvements have, since then, been made
by arranging the colours, or rather the variation, of lights along a
line of coast, so that the navigator may be able, at once, to distinguish
one light from the other. For instance, some are fixed, single
or double, white, red, or flash lights, or are revolving, displaying
alternately these or other colours. But it has been found that red
glass absorbs nearly two-thirds of the power of the light, and thus
is to a very large extent deprived of its usefulness. Indeed, it has
been found that colour of any kind used to distinguish one light
from another materially lessens its power. Consequently, we are now
adopting other means to distinguish one light from another on any
given line of coast. That is, we make eclipses of opaque shades revolving
round the usual lighting apparatus, and these we can vary
so as to show 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 seconds of darkness with similar or
greater intervals of bright light. We may thus use altogether white
or bright lights, which have the greatest power to work in such a
manner that one can be easily distinguished from another. I may add
that <i>electric</i> light, instead of that produced by oil or gas, has been tried
within the last few years. One of these lights was fixed in 1871
on Souter Point, coast of Durham. The flashes were of 5 seconds’
duration, with dark intervals of 25 seconds. The apparatus producing
this effect consisted of a dioptric of the third order for fixed lights,
around which there was an octagonal drum of glass, consisting of
panels of eight vertical lenses; by these the divergent and continuous
sheet of light from the fixed portion of the apparatus was gathered up
so as to form distinct beams which successively reach the observer as the
panels pass in succession before him. The electricity for the production
of the spark was generated by one of Professor Holmes’ magnetic-electric
machines, worked by a steam-engine of four or five horse-power.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_143" href="#FNanchor_143" class="label">[143]</a> It is to be regretted that the management of all the lights, buoys,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_144" href="#FNanchor_144" class="label">[144]</a> Apart from the aid thus rendered, there is a noble institution for
the saving of life from shipwreck on the coasts of the United Kingdom,
established in 1824, and maintained entirely by voluntary subscriptions.
It is not merely well known in this country, but throughout the
world, for no other nation of either ancient or modern times has produced
such a truly philanthropic society as the “Royal National Lifeboat
Institution of Great Britain.” It has now upwards of 250 life-boats
stationed on different parts of our coast. Since its establishment it
has expended on life-boats, and other means for saving life from
shipwreck, upwards of 356,000<i>l.</i>; it has awarded 91 gold and 863
silver medals, and 45,200<i>l.</i> in coin to brave men as rewards for saving
life; while those who manage its affairs and provide the necessary
means, have for <i>their</i> reward the inestimable satisfaction of knowing,
that the Institution has been the means of extricating from a watery
grave and restoring to their friends, during the last half century, no
less than 22,660 human beings, of every kindred and of every tongue.
How insignificant are the honours conferred by monarchs compared
with those which such labours of mercy as these bestow! Its boats,
as I have said, are stationed on every part of the coast; and where the
rocks are most rugged and the quicksands most deceptive, there these
noble craft are to be found with their voluntary crews, the bravest of
the brave, daring the rudest storms to save the lives of their fellow-men,
and too frequently placing their own lives in the greatest peril.
The boats are built expressly for the purpose of encountering heavy
storms. The medium, or thirty-feet boat, to pull ten oars double-banked,
is probably the best adapted for the general purposes of a
life-boat; but, on the Norfolk and Suffolk coasts, and other places, some
of the boats actually in use are from forty to forty-five feet in length,
weighing from four to five tons, and fitted with lug-sails. These
boats put to sea on their grand mission of mercy during the most tempestuous
weather.</p>

<p>I remember, a quarter of a century ago, attending, in conjunction
with its generous-hearted Chairman, the late Mr. Thomas Wilson, and
its present excellent Chief Secretary, Mr. Richard Lewis, and other
gentlemen, a meeting which had for its object the renovation of this
noble and truly national institution. Its annual income was then
only 150<i>l.</i>; its income is now upwards of 40,000<i>l.</i> per annum! But
it is only due to the foresight of Lord Cardwell to state that, seeing,
when President of the Board of Trade, in 1854, the value that such an
institution was likely to prove, he recommended a small Government
subsidy to aid it during its struggle for existence. His approval, more
than the money voted, was then of great advantage, and he must now
look back with no ordinary satisfaction to his thoughtful and generous
recommendation. Nor must I withhold from Government the credit due
to it for establishing that almost equally valuable and useful contrivance,
the Rocket Apparatus, managed by the Coast Guard, under the directions
of the Board of Trade, and supported from the Mercantile Marine Fund.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_145" href="#FNanchor_145" class="label">[145]</a> I have frequently thought it would be desirable to institute an
inquiry into <i>all</i> losses at sea, where reliable evidence can be obtained.
I should have every loss recorded, with a brief notice of the cause of
loss, and this record should either be open to the inspection of the
public, or published annually by order of Parliament. It would be
instructive and valuable, and would, I think, tend to materially
lessen disasters at sea, by distinguishing those which arose from unavoidable
accidents and those which might have been avoided. Indeed,
so strong are my convictions on this subject that, if spared for a few
years longer (which I can hardly hope to be, as I am physically myself
a wreck), I hope to write another book, to be entitled the ‘Annals of
the Sea,’ giving an account of all disastrous shipwrecks, and calling
attention to those which would not have happened had ordinary
prudence been exercised.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_146" href="#FNanchor_146" class="label">[146]</a> This Bill was introduced by Sir J. D. Elphinstone and Mr. Laird.
I opposed it on principle, as I felt that it was an unnecessary interference
with the duty of shipowners; and that, if chain cables were to
be tested by Government inspectors, we should be obliged to appoint
inspectors to examine and report on every article of a ship’s equipment,
thus as a matter of fact relieving shipowners from their responsibility
to the public. Besides, by subjecting chain cables to an enormous
and an unnecessary strain, the fibre of the iron was likely to be
destroyed or rendered more brittle, and, hence, less to be depended on.
All legislation in this direction should be narrowly watched, and the
line carefully drawn, as, in too many instances, it is likely to do more
harm than good. Indeed, I cannot too strongly impress upon the
minds of persons who have to deal with such questions the impolicy of
every measure which has for its object the performance by Government
officials of duties belonging to the shipowner, as every such measure
necessarily tends to relieve him from his responsibility to the public.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_147" href="#FNanchor_147" class="label">[147]</a> 25 &amp; 26 Vict., chap. 63. This Act altered the law of 1854 by
making the limit a sum dependent on the tonnage for 15<i>l.</i> per ton
in case of damage for loss of life, and 8<i>l.</i> per ton for loss of goods. It
was found that the law of 1854, by making the value of the ship and
freight in all cases the limit of damages, gave a premium to bad, cheap,
and ill-found ships, since the owner of the cheap ships could recover
against the owner of the valuable ship up to a large limit, while the
owner of the valuable ship could only recover against the other a very
small amount. It also encouraged the conveyance of passengers in
ships of an inferior description.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_148" href="#FNanchor_148" class="label">[148]</a> I look back with great pleasure to the part I took, however humble,
in connection with this great measure. Though it was the Act of
Lord Aberdeen’s Government, its credit is mainly due to Mr. (now
Lord) Cardwell, then President of the Board of Trade, to Mr. (now
Sir Henry) Thring, by whom it was drawn with great ability and care,
and to Mr. T. H. Farrer, then Secretary of the Marine Department, whose
clear head, sound judgment, thorough knowledge of maritime law, and
unwearied exertions, were of the greatest value to the able minister
under whom he acted. Perhaps, in the whole history of Parliament,
no Bill at all approaching its dimensions and the multiplicity of subjects
with which it dealt, was ever carried through the House of Commons
with so much unanimity, and in so short a space of time, as the
Merchant Shipping Act of 1854; and, as the manner in which this
was done may be useful to the legislators of to-day and of the future,
I shall endeavour to state the mode of procedure. Mr. Cardwell, having
made himself thoroughly master of the subject by a careful study of
the existing mercantile marine laws of our own and other countries in
all their details, invited to the Board of Trade the representatives of all
the leading seaports in the kingdom, and having furnished them with
an outline of his views, wisely sought their aid in the construction of
his great measure. He courted discussion in every form, and, in no
instance, declined to receive a deputation from shipowners, sailors, and
other persons who could furnish him with useful information on the
subject. By such means he was able, not, however, without much
labour, though it was unseen and unknown, to complete and perfect a
most difficult and valuable legislative measure, the whole of the clauses
of which he carried through the House of Commons in one day’s sitting
between the hours of 12.30 and 5.45! No such legislative feat has
ever been performed before or since. Nor was it, indeed, a less perfect
measure than various others of one quarter its size, which had occupied
the attention of Parliament for as many days as the hours appropriated
by the House to its discussion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliamentary
inquiry,
1854-5, on
Passenger
ships.</div>

<p>Although by the Act of 1854,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> as well as by previous
Acts,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> all Passenger ships were to be surveyed,
the impulse given to emigration by the gold discoveries
in Australia, and the increased demand for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>labour in America, combined with other causes,
induced Parliament, in 1854, to appoint another
Committee of the House of Commons, besides the
one which sat in 1851, to inquire into this now important
subject, and to pass an Act, in the following
year which is the chief Act now in force (18 &amp; 19
Vict. c. 119) exclusively directed to the conveyance
of passengers by sea, more especially of that class of
persons known as emigrants.</p>

<p>Between 1815 and 1854, inclusive, 4,116,958
passengers left the United Kingdom, being upon an
average 102,923 persons annually. But of this
vast number 2,446,802, or nearly three-fifths, emigrated
during the eight years previous to 1854,
and 1,358,096 of them in the previous four years.
So great had the rage for emigration become,
that in 1854, no less a sum than 1,730,000<i>l.</i> was
remitted by settlers in North America to their
relations and friends in the United Kingdom for
the express purpose of enabling those who had
been left at home to join them in their adopted
country.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Heavy
losses at
sea previously,
and especially
in
1854.</div>

<p>Yet these acts of generosity and self-denial, altogether
unparalleled in the history of the world (we
have no record of any such acts in the great tides of
emigration from the East, and in those which peopled
Carthage from Phœœnicia), had been performed during
many previous years, the sums remitted for this
purpose having varied from about half a million
sterling to more than a million and a half annually.
This rush for emigration having induced Shipowners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
eager to reap so rich a harvest, to place vessels in
the trade, many of which were altogether unsuited
for it, with other causes, compelled the Legislature
to investigate the whole subject; the result being
the comprehensive Passenger Act of 1855, which
was passed not one day too soon. During the
<i>seven</i> years ending December 1853, no fewer than
<i>sixty-one</i> ships were lost in this trade, with the
further lamentable loss of 1567 lives. In 1854, alone,
<i>nine</i> emigrant ships were wrecked. Five of these
were from Liverpool, including the <i>Tayleur</i>, stranded
on Lundy Island, when 330 persons perished, and
the <i>City of Glasgow</i>, having on board 430 souls,
who, with the ship, were never afterwards heard
of. The <i>Black Hawk</i> and <i>Winchester</i> foundered at
sea in the great storm of the 15th and 17th of April;
the <i>City of Philadelphia</i> steamer was wrecked on
Cape Race, Newfoundland, in August, as well as the
ship <i>Tottenham</i>, from Cork to Quebec, on Cape
Breton, but, happily, in these instances no lives
were lost.</p>

<p>Such were the disastrous total losses of British
ships in 1854; and, although few or any of these
losses can be attributed to unseaworthiness, the loss
of life was so appalling, that the Legislature was
led to bestow more than usual attention to the
subject. But besides these, several ships were so
seriously injured that they were compelled to return
for repairs. One loss, that of the <i>Powhattan</i>, was a
singularly melancholy one. This vessel sailed from
Liverpool with German emigrants on board, and,
after sustaining much other damage, was, afterwards,
wrecked at Barnagat, off the coast by New Jersey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
during the gale of the 16th April: although stranded
within eighty yards of low-water mark, and so near,
indeed, that the unfortunate people on board could
hear and reply to the suggestions made to them by
persons on the land, not a single individual reached
the shore, though the vessel did not break up for
twenty-four hours after she struck.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Emigration
system.</div>

<p>But other causes had long been at work to render
necessary a revision of the laws relating
to passenger ships. The rate of passage being generally
higher from Ireland than from Liverpool, on
account of the difficulty of procuring cargo, most of
the Irish emigrants were shipped on the decks of
the coasting steamers to that port; thence, they
either secured their passage through the Irish agents
of the Liverpool brokers, or they found their way
to that port at their own expense, and procured
tickets for themselves. Others again, for they were
nearly all of the very poorest class of persons, many
of them having no means whatever after their passage
and their little outfit were paid, acted on orders sent
home from New York, their passage-money having
been prepaid by their friends or relations in America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frauds
practised
on emigrants.</div>

<p>In the first case, instances occurred where emigrants
had paid their passage-money, or a part of it,
to unauthorized or insolvent parties, and, on arriving
at Liverpool, found no ship, nor any broker liable
for the passage. In the case of orders remitted from
America, the emigrant was of course liable to a
similar fraud, with the additional aggravation that,
the offence having been committed in a foreign
country, there was no chance of obtaining redress
for the sufferer or of punishment to the offender.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
When, however, Irish emigration became so important,
and such large sums were remitted from
settlers in America, the business became more
systematic and fell into more respectable hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Runners
and
crimps.</div>

<p>The moment, however, the emigrant set foot on
the quay at Liverpool he was beset by a crowd of
runners and crimps, one of whom seized his baggage
and carried it to the lodging-house in the interest of
which he was acting. This runner, besides plundering
the emigrant to the extent, at least, of exorbitant
charges for lodgings, received 7½ per cent. on
the passage-money from the passenger broker;
and, indeed, at one time, obtained this without
any communication with the passenger. Although
a clause in a previous Act<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> had been inserted to
check so great an extortion, the system proved
stronger than the law; and, notwithstanding further
steps were taken to remedy this evil, the percentage
was still demanded and paid, though the service
was performed without authority. The passenger
broker reimbursed himself for this tax by charging
the exorbitant commission of 12½ per cent. against
the charterer or shipowner; the charge ultimately
falling upon the emigrant in the shape of an increased
rate of passage.</p>

<p>The emigrant was further persuaded by the
runner that it was necessary to lay in a stock of
provisions for the voyage, together with other purchases,
on all which the runner got a percentage.
Great frauds were also perpetrated in “dollaring,”
that is, in exchanging money, in which the emigrant
was robbed at least 20 per cent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Remedies
proposed.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Average
price, then,
of passages.</div>

<p>Although various plans were suggested to the
committee, with a view of putting an end to the
evils complained of, it is only necessary to refer
to that part of the question which affects the actual
shipping and conveyance of the passenger to his
destination. It was generally agreed that the
existing regulations were not stringent enough, the
great object of the previous Acts having been to
give as much security as possible to the passengers;
but it was found impossible to obtain this without
increasing the price of passage, which had fallen
from 5<i>l.</i> in 1842 to 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> in 1851, from Liverpool
to New York, and about 5<i>s.</i> less to Quebec,
including provisions. It is further to be noted
that, though in 1842 the charge was higher, there
was less given for it, as the Shipowners supplied
only two-thirds of the amount of provisions provided
at the latter period. While the law, in fact,
had obliged the Shipowner to supply a larger quantity
of provisions, restrictions as to the extent of the
provisions added, together with a superior dietary
scale, the money price of the passage had been materially
diminished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Emigration
officer.</div>

<p>In 1864, the inspection of passenger ships and
provisions was carried on at Liverpool, for example,
by an Emigration officer, and two assistants who
were lieutenants in the Royal Navy. The Emigration
officer had to satisfy himself of the seaworthiness
of every ship which came under the Act; to
see that no greater number of passengers were
carried than her measured space would allow according
to law; that her boats were sufficient, and
that she had the necessary stock of provisions and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
water for the number of passengers to be carried, and
that they were of good quality. He had further to
attend to the complaints of the emigrants, and to procure
redress for them where necessary. The provisions
were tested by the arbitrary selection of some barrels
of flour or oatmeal, which were bored through with
an auger, so that a fair sample might be brought
up and tasted. Whenever any suspicion existed,
the inspection was more minute, and the duty of
tasting became very irksome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medical
inspection.</div>

<p>The medical inspection of emigrants took place
at Liverpool, not on board the ship, but in an office
adjoining the dock. The emigrant, taking with him
his contract ticket, proceeded to the medical office,
which he entered at one door, and, if approved on
the inspection, had his ticket stamped, and passed
out at another. He was compelled to produce
his ticket on embarking. A system such as this
naturally opened a door to fraud and personation,
while, not unfrequently, after personal examination
the emigrant contracted an infectious disorder, the
infection spreading before the diseased person could
be removed from the ship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">American
emigration
law.</div>

<p>By the United States Statute of the 22nd February,
1847, it was provided that the space to be allowed to
passengers should be fourteen clear superficial feet of
deck for each passenger, if such vessel did not pass
within the Tropics. By an Act of 1848 this was so far
altered, that when “the height between the decks is
less than six feet, and more than five feet, each passenger
shall be allowed sixteen superficial feet; but
if the height between decks be less than five feet,
then twenty-two superficial feet; and for every passenger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
on the orlop deck, thirty feet.” Under our Act,
no ship could clear out that had not six feet between
the decks. In some cases the law of the United
States was but loosely observed; while other cases,
doubtless, occurred where English vessels sailed from
Liverpool to New Orleans with a number greatly
exceeding what they could legitimately carry, but
which they had reason to expect would not be
noticed on their arrival. Owing, however, to some
change of persons at the Custom House at New
Orleans an inspection was instituted; two vessels
were heavily fined, and one was confiscated. But
it was found more difficult to provide against the
frauds practised by the Shipowners in supplying
bad or unwholesome provisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dietary,
then, required.</div>

<p>The amount of provision by the Parliamentary
scale to each adult passenger per week was, viz.,
water, 21 quarts; biscuit, 2½ lbs.; wheaten flour, 1 lb.;
oatmeal, 5 lbs.; rice, 2 lbs.; molasses, 2 lbs., to be
issued in advance, at the interval of twice a week.
Potatoes might be given in lieu of oatmeal or rice,
in the proportion of 5 lbs. of potatoes for 1 lb. of
oatmeal or rice; and, in vessels sailing from Liverpool,
or from Scotch or Irish ports, oatmeal might
be substituted in equal quantities for rice. The
dietary was afterwards altered by the Act of 1851,
an alternative scale being promulgated, with the
substitution of beef or pork, preserved meat, salt
fish, split peas, &amp;c., &amp;c., for bread-stuffs. This more
expensive scale was adopted in the ports, whence
English emigrants usually sailed; but, besides the
legal supply, nearly every emigrant took with him
some additional provision, such as bacon, eggs, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disgraceful
state of
emigrant
ships at
that time.</div>

<p>The filthy state of these ships during the passage
was, at that period, worse than anything that could
be imagined. It was scarcely possible to induce the
passengers to sweep the decks after their meals, or
to be decent with respect to the common wants of
nature; in many cases, in bad weather, they could
not go on deck, their health suffered so much that
their strength was gone, and they had not the power
to help themselves.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Hence, “between decks” was
like a loathsome dungeon. When the hatchways
were opened under which the people were stowed, the
steam rose, and the stench was like that from a pen
of pigs. The few beds they had were in a dreadful
state, for the straw, once wet with sea-water, soon
rotted; besides which, they used the between decks
for all sorts of filthy purposes. Whenever vessels put
back from distress, all these miseries and sufferings
were exhibited in the most aggravated form. In one
case, it appeared that the vessel, having experienced
rough weather, the people were unable to go on
deck and cook their provisions; the strongest maintained
the upper hand over the weakest; and it was
even said that there were women, who died of starvation.
The passengers were then expected to cook for
themselves (they no longer do so), and, from being
unable to do this, the greatest suffering arose. It
was at the commencement of the voyage, that this
system, naturally, produced its worst effects. The
first days were those in which the people suffered
most from sea-sickness, and, under the prostration
of body thereby induced, were wholly incapacitated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>from cooking; the absence of food, if it does not
aggravate, at any rate preventing recovery from
sickness: and thus, even though the provisions
might be honestly and liberally issued—casks in some
cases being opened and placed on deck for every one
to help himself—yet the passengers would be half-starved.
It was time that a system, so barbarous and
withal so unnecessary, should be altered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Act of
1852.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Resolution
of New
York
Legislature,
1854.</div>

<p>In 1852, various recommendations made were carried
into effect by a bill brought in by Mr. Frederick
Peel; and, in 1855, the whole law was consolidated and
greatly improved by the Passengers Act of that year.
In fact, it cannot be denied that whatever improvements
had taken place through the operation of the
laws of 1849 and 1852, the passengers on board
emigrant ships were still, as a rule, great sufferers.
The United States Legislatures bear convincing testimony
on this point, as, on the 6th January, 1854,
that of the State of New York passed a series of
resolutions, calling the attention of Congress to the
great and increasing mortality on board vessels engaged
in the business of carrying emigrants <i>during
the previous twelve months</i>, bringing forward undoubted
evidence that such suffering and death resulted from
insufficient ventilation, &amp;c. The Senate, agreeing
with the prayer of these resolutions, concurred, also,
in the propriety of inquiry and further legislation.
All intelligent, independent parties admitted, indeed,
the expediency of concerting an effective system of
co-operation between the two governments, so as to
prevent an infraction of the regulations mutually
agreed upon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
as to iron
cargoes.</div>

<p>In conformity with the evidence adduced, frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
disasters to emigrant vessels were ascribed to the
effects produced by cargoes of iron; while the inconsiderate
manner in which some owners, charterers,
or brokers, even against the remonstrances of the
commanders and officers, persisted in thus loading
their vessels, was alleged to be a fruitful source of
disaster.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> It is likely that the mortality at sea was
increased by such cargoes, as they made the ship
labour heavily, causing her at the same time to ship
a great quantity of water, with the further probability
of producing leaks. The people, too, had then to
work at the pumps, were hard fagged and badly fed.
But the owners or charterers for a time resisted
Government intervention, asserting that the Legislature
ought not to fetter mercantile enterprise; and,
further, that, if ships were restricted as to cargo, the
price of the passage must be raised. On the other
hand, it was proposed to give a larger discretionary
power to the Emigration officer, so as to prevent improper
and dangerous stowage. The insufficiency of
existing measures of precautions for the preservation
of health; the dietaries, the quality of the ships taken
up for passengers, the runners, lodging, detention,
&amp;c., of emigrants, all became subjects of consideration,
and, especially, the number of boats necessary to
be carried.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Various
attempts
at improvement.</div>

<p>Accordingly, it appeared absolutely necessary that
the authority of the Emigration officers to control the
stowage of heavy cargo should be placed beyond
doubt; that the number of passengers for whom a
surgeon should be required should be reduced from
500 to 300; that the Queen in Council should have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>authority to make special regulations, in excess of
the law, for the prevention of sickness on board ship
during the prevalence of epidemics; that the space
allowed under the existing Act should be increased;
that it should be obligatory to provide water-closets
in the “between decks” for women and children;
that a more ample dietary should be prescribed;
that no ship should carry more than 500 passengers;
that the number of passengers necessary to
bring a ship under the Act should be reduced from
one to twenty-five to one to fifty tons; that the
exemption of ships carrying mails should be clearly
defined; that runners should be required to wear
badges; and, finally, that the subsistence-money in
case of detention should be increased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Legislation
in the
United
States,
1855.</div>

<p>Concurrently with the proceedings taken on this
side of the Atlantic, the Senate of the United States
also took the matter up, but they relied, chiefly, on the
answers given to a series of questions framed and
addressed to parties competent to give information.
Their recommendations, therefore, well deserve notice.
Thus, they urged that a space should be reserved on
the upper deck for exercise in proportion to the number
carried; that a ship’s capacity should be limited by
tonnage as well as space; that, during the winter
months, the number allowed in proportion to tonnage
should be reduced; that no passengers should
be carried on an orlop deck; that the number of
privies should be increased, with separate accommodation
for females; that provisions should be issued
cooked; that rules should be established for the
maintenance of discipline; and, lastly, that the ship
should be made responsible to the extent of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
passage-money in the case of passengers dying at
sea.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>The first Bill proposed in the United States did
not pass. But, in 1855, a Passenger Act to regulate
the carriage of passengers in steam-ships and other
vessels, was introduced and became law. This latter
Bill, though much less stringent than the Bill
originally proposed, and in respect to space even
less so than the previously existing law, introduced
several new provisions of considerable value, the
chief of which was a more ample dietary scale, and
a provision that the master should, on his arrival,
report every death on the voyage, and pay on account
of such death a fine of 10 dollars. The fines
so paid were made applicable to the care and protection
of sick, indigent, or destitute emigrants; and
the object in imposing the fine was to give the
master of the ship a pecuniary interest in the health
of his passengers. It was thought by some, that if
this could be effected, a great step would be made
towards improving their treatment on board. There
was, however, a risk that masters would, by insurance,
neutralise this interest, as was once attempted as
respects the second moiety of passage-money in the
case of emigrants sent to Australia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uniformity
of
action impossible.</div>

<p>Of course it was in the highest degree desirable
that the laws of the United States and those of
England with regard to passenger ships should be
assimilated.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Indeed, various committees of the House
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>of Commons and many eminent philanthropists had
urged this assimilation, the main protection for passengers
being to be secured by an inquiry as to their
treatment by officers appointed at the place of arrival.
There can be no doubt that, with a view to a perfect
system, the laws on both sides the Atlantic ought to be
identical; but the United States government, apart
from the necessary diversity of regulations in various
States of the Union, is placed in this further difficulty.
The United Kingdom is not the only, nor will it be,
hereafter, the principal source from which emigrants
reach the United States. Large multitudes depart
from German, Belgian, and French ports, and in 1853
and 1854, many emigrants sailed from ports in Norway.
The passenger laws in each of these countries
differ from each other, and even more from the law of
the United States. There was, therefore, an insuperable
difficulty in framing, on the other side of the Atlantic,
a law so general as to embrace the provisions
of the several European laws, without making it so
vague as to be practically worthless.</p>

Act, 1855.</div>

<p>But our Passengers’ Amendment Act of 1855,
which came into operation on the 1st October of that
year, made some important advances towards the law
of the United States. The principal alterations introduced
by this Act, beyond the regulations of 1852, were,
that the number of passengers was limited; the age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
of a “statute adult” reduced from fourteen to twelve
years; a distinction was made between the upper and
lower passenger deck; increase of space was allowed
to passengers; mail steamers were exempted under
special rules; the dietary scale improved; the amount
of detention-money increased; and the emigrant
runners placed under more efficient control.</p>

<p>One chief provision of the Passengers’ Act required
that an abstract thereof and of the Orders in
Council should be posted up in each emigrant ship.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
The Emigration Commissioners, in their report of
1857, give an opinion that the Act has worked
satisfactorily; that the changes introduced have
tended, materially, to add to the comfort and promote
the health of emigrants, the returns of mortality
in ships to the United States attesting the
same result.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> On the other hand, the reduction in
the number a ship might carry, and the increase in
the dietary, necessarily added to the expenses of the
passage, and, to a certain extent, diminished for a
time the amount of emigration. Further, the Commissioners
stated that the runners, at the ports of
departure, have been brought more effectually under
control, so as to prevent many of the abuses formerly
prevalent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt
to check
issue of
fraudulent
tickets.</div>

<p>In the United States, also, and especially at New
York, efforts have been made to stop the frauds
heretofore committed by this class on emigrants.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>In that city, an establishment, under the control of
the Commissioners for Emigration, has been set on
foot at Castle Garden, to protect emigrants from
runners, and from those who sell them fraudulent
or false inland passage-tickets. In consequence of
a representation from the United States Government,
whereby it appeared that, the suppression in the
States, of frauds connected with the sale of inland
tickets had led to a system of selling the same description
of tickets in Europe or on board emigrant
ships, an official notice of this fact was given to emigrants,
cautioning them that the safest course was
not to purchase an inland ticket in England, but to
defer making arrangements for the passage up the
country, till their arrival at the port of debarkation.
This notice, however, applied to the United
States only; and it was stated, explicitly, that the
through tickets given by the Grand Trunk Railway
of Canada to emigrants proceeding to the St. Lawrence
were not open to suspicion, and were, besides,
of great benefit to the emigrant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
improvements.</div>

<p>Among the improvements in ships carried out by
the Emigration Commissioners, we should mention
that they have introduced, of late years, a more
suitable dietary for young children, with the making
of fresh bread, two or three times a week, for the
passengers. This change has been also authorized
in private ships. Several new systems of ventilation
have, also, been tried. In a sailing passenger
ship, especially during the calms which prevail on
the Line, their proper ventilation will always prove
a matter of greater difficulty than is the case with
a steamer, whose own motion is sufficient to create a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
current of air. Further experience on this point is,
however, necessary, though very considerable improvements
have recently been made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Merchant
Shipping
Act discussed.</div>

<p>As great fault was found by the central committee
of the General Shipowners’ Society with the 504th
section of the Merchant Shipping Act (Part IX.),
which lays down the measure of the owners’ liability,
it may be desirable to state the nature of the
complaints. This section of the Act provides:—</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extent of
owners’
liability.</div>

<p>1st. Where any loss of life or personal injury is
caused to any person being carried in such ship:</p>

<p>2nd. Where any damage or loss is caused to any
goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever on
board any such ship:</p>

<p>3rd. Where any loss of life or personal injury
is, by reason of the improper navigation of such
sea-going ship as aforesaid, caused to any person
carried in any other ship or boat:</p>

<p>4th. Where any loss or damage is, by reason of
any such improper navigation of such sea-going ships
as aforesaid, caused by any other ship or boat, or
to any goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever
on board any other ship or boat: No owner
shall, in such cases where the events occur without
his knowledge or privity, be answerable in damages
to an extent beyond the value of his ship and the
freight due, or to grow due, in respect of such
ship during the voyage which, at the time of the
happening of such event, as aforesaid, is in prosecution
or contracted for, subject to the following
proviso, that is to say: that, in no case, where any
liability, as aforesaid, is incurred in respect of loss
of life or personal injury to the passenger, shall the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
value of such ship and the freight thereof be taken
to be less than 15<i>l.</i> per registered ton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unnecessary
outcry
of the
Shipowners.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Question
of limited
liability.</div>

<p>The central body of Shipowners, while protesting<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
against the injustice of this Act, forgot that, in point
of fact, the limitation of their liability was thereby
secured, which it was not under the common law of
England. They further contended that the 511th
clause of the Merchant Shipping Act was inconsistent
with the 504th clause, as the former enacts
that parties seeking compensation may refuse to
accept the indemnity awarded by the authorities
constituted by the Act,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> and may bring an action
against the Shipowner for damages, by which he
might be rendered liable to an amount in many
cases involving the whole of his capital. But the
clause providing that any person who is dissatisfied
with the amount of statutory damages (30<i>l.</i> each
person) may bring an action on his own account,
enacts expressly “that any damages recoverable by
such person shall be payable only out of the residue,
<i>if any</i>, of the aggregate amount for which the
owner is liable, after deducting all sums paid to
her Majesty’s Paymaster-General in manner aforesaid;
and, if the damages recovered in such action
do not exceed <i>double</i> the statutory amount, such
person is liable to pay all the costs as between
attorney and client.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of
life.</div>

<p>On the other hand, if, as was observed by way
of illustration in the course of discussion, a bishop
were to fall a victim to an accident, it might be considered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>that an assessment of 30<i>l.</i> would not compensate
the surviving members of the bishop’s family
for such loss. There can be no doubt that the
framers of the present law, when repealing the old
laws, endeavoured to deal substantial justice. They
must have felt that, to exempt Shipowners from
liability beyond the value of the ship and freight
would, in too many instances, be an encouragement
for unscrupulous persons to employ worn-out and
inadequately-manned vessels in the conveyance of
passengers and emigrants: and on the other hand,
that to subject Shipowners, guilty of no fault or
default, to unlimited liability for such calamities
would induce men of property and character to
withdraw their fortunes from so great a hazard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Powers
given to
the Board
of Trade.</div>

<p>To prevent as far as possible either of these evils,
and to insure compensation for personal injury, or
injury consequent from loss of life, was one great
object of the existing Acts; and fully to carry it
into effect, the Board of Trade has now power to
require the sheriff to summon a jury for the purpose
of ascertaining the number, names, and descriptions
of all persons killed or injured by reason of any
wrongful act, neglect, or default.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Mode of
procedure
in inquiries
about loss
of life.</div>

<p>At such an inquiry the Board of Trade is plaintiff,
and the Shipowner liable for the occurrence the
defendant.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> A special jury may be called, and the
usual precautions as to costs are adopted. The
Board of Trade may make any compromise it thinks
fit as to damages, which are, in each case of death
or injury, to be assessed at the statutory 30<i>l.</i>, and
are made the first charge on the aggregate amount
for which the owner is liable. The Act regulates
the proceedings, and confers extensive powers on
the Board of Trade in the distribution of the funds.
With regard to any dissatisfied person claiming
more, he is liable, if he does not recover damages
to double the statutory amount, to pay costs to the
defendant Shipowner; and, even if he obtains a
verdict, the damages recoverable are still to be
payable out of the residue, if any, of the aggregate
amount for which the Shipowner is liable, after
deducting all sums paid to Her Majesty’s Paymaster-General.
In cases, where several claims are made
or apprehended, against the Shipowner for loss of
life, personal injury, or loss or damage to ships,
boats, or goods, he may appeal to the Court of
Chancery to determine the amount of his liability;
the question of liability or non-liability being left
to another jurisdiction. But it has been held that
a Shipowner, who applies to a court of Equity in
order to obtain its assistance, must admit that he
has incurred some liability. Of course, all costs in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>relation to these matters may be brought into
account among the part-owners of the same ship,
in the same manner as any other moneys disbursed
for the use thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
complaints
of the
Shipowners,</div>

<p>Some of the Shipowners complained of the reintroduction
of a liability nearly unlimited as set
forth in the 511th clause,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> urging that foreign shipowners
could not be rendered liable to its operation,
and that Shipowners are expressly exempted from
liability for damage caused by the negligence or
misconduct of licensed pilots, on the very ground
that their competency has been tested and approved
by public authorities. This last argument is, however,
wholly untenable, unless a perfect immunity is
to be accorded to every ship-master who may have
obtained a certificate of qualification. The municipal
law of one State can only bind those subjects
who owe allegiance thereto; but all civilised States
frame regulations for the protection of life and
property. It would be very difficult to suggest
any improvement in the law. The provisions in
the Merchant Shipping Act were the result of profound
consideration, and ought to be deemed to have
effected as reasonable an adjustment as is possible,
between the owners of sea-going ships and persons
sustaining damage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">who think
too much
discretion
has been
given to
the Emigration
officer.</div>

<p>With regard to the Passenger Act, the central
body of Shipowners further complained of the discretionary
power exercised by the Emigration officer;
and, in recent reports, have called attention to
those provisions which “while they harass the Shipowner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
do not in the least tend to the advantage,
comfort, or safety of the passengers;” the consequence
of so much being left to the discretion of the
Emigration officer leading, as they thought, to this,
that the mode of fitting out emigrant vessels depends
mainly on his will, and varies, therefore, with each
port from which the vessel sails.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The “fiend discretion,”
as a well-known writer<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> has described it, is no
doubt ever abhorrent to Englishmen, who watch, with
Constitutional jealousy, the rights of property and of
the subject. But it is, indeed, the cardinal difficulty
of administration. A hard and fast law stops improvement,
and reduces everything to a dead level.
Discretion may be tyranny. The experience, however,
of the frauds, oppression, and cruelties, practised
in former years on the unprotected emigrant, will, I
doubt not, continue to operate on the Legislature,
and will prevent them from relaxing many portions
of the present rigorous system, which has at least
produced various salutary improvements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Though
slightly
since
modified,
principle
of Passenger
Act
remains
the same.</div>

<p>Though modifications and alterations have been
made in the Passenger Act of 1855, the most important
of which has been the transfer of its management
from the Emigration Commissioners to the
Board of Trade, its leading principles are still unchanged,
and these, in their main features, have now
been adopted by nearly all other countries. The
changes most worthy of note are to be found (Clause
35, &amp;c.) in the Merchant Shipping Acts Amendment
Act of 1862, which gives the owner or master of
any passenger ship power to reject, as a passenger,
any “drunken or disorderly” person; or to land
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>such person, or others, as “molest or continue to
molest any passenger,” at any convenient port in
the United Kingdom. Power is also given in this
Act to inflict a penalty, not exceeding 20<i>l</i>., on any
passenger who interferes with the crew in the execution
of their duty; or “who wilfully does, or causes
to be done, anything in such a manner as to obstruct
or injure any part of the machinery or tackle of such
steamer.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
“rule of
the road at
sea.”</div>

<p>The Act of 1862 also laid down more clear and
distinct sailing rules; and as these are of great importance,
I furnish them at length in a footnote.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
For these rules the country is greatly indebted to
the exertions of Mr. Milner Gibson, when President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
of the Board of Trade, without whose practical
knowledge of the subject (as a first-class yachtsman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
and navigator), and his patience and temper, the
nautical men connected with the Board of Trade and
Trinity House, as well as various naval officers, in
office and out of doors, would never have consented
to them. Even now we frequently read in the daily
press letters opposed to these rules, just as we find
writers on finance who have their currency hobbies,
and who are not, and never will be, satisfied with Sir
Robert Peel’s Bank Charter Act of 1844.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Examination
now
required
for engineers
as
well as
masters of
steam-ships.</div>

<p>By the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854, the master
and chief mate of all sea-going vessels, whether sailing
ships or steamers, are, as I have already explained,
required to possess a certificate of previous
servitude or of competency. The Act of 1862 extended,
and to great advantage, the principle of examination,
also, to engineers engaged in sea-going
steamers, who, since then, have been required to
undergo an examination, and produce certificates of
good conduct and sobriety. Their certificates of competency
are of two grades—first class and second
class. Any sea-going home-trade <i>passenger</i> steamer,
or any foreign-going steam-ship of more than one
hundred horse-power nominal, must, therefore, now
carry, at least, one engineer who possesses a certificate
of competency; and all steamers of greater power
must have, at least, two such engineers, one of whom
may be of the second class. But all engineers who
had served as such in sea-going vessels, previously
to the 1st April, 1862, were entitled to a certificate
of service, and were not required to undergo an
examination.</p>

<p>Though many owners of steam-ships were strongly
opposed to any legislative interference with the engineers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
whom they employed, alleging, among other
reasons, that they were thus frequently prevented
from promoting men in their service who had served
them well and faithfully—as for instance, those in
an inferior capacity, such as the head stoker—there
can be no doubt that the effect of the law, enforcing
these examinations, has been as salutary in
the case of engineers as it has proved in the case of
masters and mates. There may be exceptions to the
rule, but, on the whole, the requirements of the Act
have tended, materially, to improve the class of men
now employed as engineers on our merchant steamers,
and have, as such, been generally accepted by the
men themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Injurious
action of
the crimps.</div>

<p>But, before closing my remarks on the mercantile
marine legislation of the twelve years subsequent to
the repeal of the Navigation Laws, there is one measure,
apparently trivial in itself, which has been a
great boon to our seamen. Before any of these Acts
came into operation, they, as I have endeavoured to
show, were to a great extent under the control of
a class of men familiarly known as “crimps,” who
were the “sailor’s agents.”<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> They found him a ship,
discounted his advance note at usurious rates, assisted
him to receive his wages at the end of the voyage,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
and <i>taught him how to spend them</i>. Previously to
the Act of 1850, seamen, on the termination of
a voyage, were either paid their wages on board<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
ship, or at the office of the Shipowner or his agents.
In either case, the crimps, most of whom were keepers
of low lodging-houses or beer-shops, were in attendance
upon the sailors, and he, who had to receive
the largest amount of pay, was attended by the most
numerous and obsequious of these vultures, each
ready to prey upon him. Suspecting no wrong, Jack
was too frequently induced, after he had received
his wages, to partake, on the invitation of the
crimps, of a glass of grog or a pint of beer at the
nearest public-house, and this, apparently, friendly
intercourse too often produced the most lamentable
results.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Savings-banks
for
seamen
instituted;</div>

<p>To obviate, or rather to mitigate if possible, these
evils, the Commissioners for the reduction of the National
Debt were empowered, by the Merchant Shipping
Act of 1854, to establish Savings-Banks for seamen;
and, by the Seamen’s Savings-Bank Act of 1856,
these banks were placed under the control of the
Board of Trade, which was authorized to open
“a central office in London, together with branch
savings-banks at such ports and places in the United
Kingdom as they may think expedient,” where “seamen,
or the wives, widows and children of seamen,”
might make deposits, not exceeding at one time 200<i>l.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">and, somewhat
later,
money-order
offices.</div>

<p>Under this Act, the Board of Trade has opened
at all the shipping offices throughout the United
Kingdom a department where the sailor, on his discharge,
may deposit the whole or any portion of his
wages; or may, by means of a money-order office,
since added, remit them to his relations or friends.
The effect has been salutary, inasmuch as the sailor
is thus, to some extent (less than I could wish), prevented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
from being plundered by depraved persons,
whose chief occupation consists in getting what they
can out of him. Although Jack may still desire to
retain from his wages enough for the proverbial
“spree” or jollification after a long sea-voyage, too
large a portion of his earnings still go to crimps
and other depraved persons; but as a considerable
amount is now either deposited at the savings-bank
or remitted home, the crimp has less inducement to
offer his very questionable services to the sailor than
he had before this excellent Act came into operation.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_161" href="#FNanchor_161" class="label">[161]</a> This power has only once been put in operation, viz., in the case

are very numerous, and too poor to bring actions for themselves. In
these cases the Board of Trade acts for them.</p>

<p>But, in ordinary cases, the passengers’ relations proceed for themselves.
The owner pays the whole amount for which he is liable into
the Court of Chancery, and that Court distributes it among all who
have claims—whether in respect of life or of property.</p>

<p>The real defects in the Act of 1854 are well pointed out by the Committee
of 1860: viz., first, that the law does not apply to foreign ships on
the high seas, whether plaintiffs or defendants; and, secondly, that
“value of ship and freight” is a premium on bad ships. These defects,
as I have already pointed out, were remedied by the Act of 1862.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Steering and Sailing Rules.</i></p>

<p>Art. 11. If two sailing vessels are meeting end on, or nearly end on,
so as to involve risk of collision, the helms of both shall be put to port,
so that each may pass on the port side of the other.</p>

<p>Art. 12. When two sailing ships are crossing, so as to involve risk of
collision, then, if they have the wind on different sides, the ship with
the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way of the ship with
the wind on the starboard side; except in the case, in which the ship
with the wind on the port side is close-hauled and the other ship free,
in which case, the latter ship shall keep out of the way; but, if they
have the wind on the same side, or if one of them has the wind aft, the
ship which is to windward shall keep out of the way of the ship which
is to leeward.</p>

<p>Art. 13. If two ships under steam are meeting end on, so as to involve
risk of collision, the helms of both shall be put to port, so that each
may pass on the port side of the other.</p>

<p>Art. 14. If two ships under steam are crossing so as to involve risk
of collision, the ship which has the other on her own starboard side
shall keep out of the way of the other.</p>

<p>Art. 15. If two ships, one of which is a sailing ship and the other a
steam-ship, are proceeding in such directions as to involve risk of
collision, <i>the steam-ship shall keep out of the way</i>, and pass astern of the
sailing ship.</p>

<p>Art. 16. Every steam-ship, when approaching another ship, so as to
involve risk of collision, shall slacken her speed, or, if necessary, stop
and reverse; and every steam-ship shall, <i>when in a fog, go at a moderate
speed</i>.</p>

<p>Art. 17. Every vessel overtaking any other vessel shall keep out of
the way of the said last-mentioned vessel.</p>

<p>Art. 18. Where, by the above rules, one of two ships is to keep out
of the way, the other shall keep her course, subject to the qualifications
contained in the following Article.</p>

<p>Art. 19. In obeying and construing these rules, due regard must be
had to all dangers of navigation; and due regard must also be had to
any special circumstances which may exist in any particular case
rendering a departure from the above rules necessary, in order to avoid
immediate danger.</p>

<p>Art. 20. Nothing, in these rules, shall exonerate any ship, or the
owner or master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect
to carry lights or signals, or of any neglect to keep a proper look-out,
or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the
ordinary practice of seamen or by the special circumstances of the
case.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Gray, one of the Assistant Secretaries to the Board of
Trade (Marine Department), feeling how important it would be to have
these rules impressed upon the minds of all navigators, and knowing
what effect rhyme has in bringing at once to recollection, for instance,
the number of days in each month, put with great tact and ingenuity
these rules into verse, thus:—</p>

<p>1. Two steam-ships meeting.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentf1">“When both side-lights you see ahead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Port your helm, and show your <i>red</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>2. Two steam-ships passing.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentf1">“<i>Green</i> to <i>green</i>, or <i>red</i> to <i>red</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perfect safety—go ahead.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>3. Two steam-ships crossing.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This is the position of greatest danger; there is nothing for it
but <i>good look-out, caution, and judgment</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentf1">“If to your starboard <i>red</i> appear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is your duty to keep clear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To act as judgment says is proper—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To port, or starboard, back, or stop her!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentf1">“But when upon your port is seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A steamer’s starboard light of <i>green</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s not so much for you to do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For <i>green</i> to port keeps clear of you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>4. All ships must keep a good look-out, and steam-ships <i>must stop,
and go astern</i>, if necessary.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentf1">“Both in safety and in doubt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Always keep a good look-out;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In danger, with no room to turn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ease her—stop her—go astern!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These appropriate but simple rhymes have been translated into
various languages, and, I doubt not, have been the means of preventing
numerous collisions and other accidents at sea. It may be amusing
and instructive to add that, when the question of lights for ships and
rules of the road at sea were under consideration, the French Government
wrote to our Government proposing a Maritime Congress to settle
them. We replied in substance, “No. A Maritime Congress of sailors
of different nations and languages will be a Babel. But we will heartily
co-operate with you; we will propose a draft of rules and submit them
to you. If France and England can agree on this, other nations will
probably join.” France adopted our proposal most cordially, and we
set to work. At that time we were fortunate enough to have Mr.
Milner Gibson at the Board of Trade, who united, as I have explained
in the text, what scarcely any other man would have done, perfect
knowledge of the subject, a clear, logical, and sensible understanding,
and a remarkable power of making other people agree. Not without
difficulty, a set of rules was, under his leadership, framed by the
Admiralty, the Trinity House and the Board of Trade acting together.
These rules were sent to the French Government. They approved
them, making some valuable criticisms, but, chiefly, criticisms of detail.
We then said, “Now let there be no question of national vanity; no
quarrel as to who originated these rules. Do you publish them in
your <i>Moniteur</i> on a given day, and we will, on the same day, publish
them in our <i>Gazette</i>, merely stating that the rules had been jointly
settled by the two Governments.” This, as might have been supposed,
was agreed on. To the surprise, however, of every one connected with
the facts, the <i>Moniteur</i> some time before the day fixed, published a
long story to the following effect:—“That the French Minister of
Marine had long been alive to the dangers to which navigation was
exposed for want of such rules; that he had communicated his apprehensions
to his colleague, the French Foreign Minister, who sympathised
with him; that he, the French Minister of Marine, thereupon prepared
a set of rules, which he sent to his colleague; that the French Foreign
Minister submitted these French rules to the English Government; that
that Government gave them its cordial and grateful approval; and that
both Governments then agreed to adopt them. Therefore, they were
to become law!”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_168" href="#FNanchor_168" class="label">[168]</a> From having been myself trained in the forecastle of a ship, I am
familiar with the character and habits of sailors at sea. Though I have
found among them some worthless characters, as may be found in all
other branches of trade, and a few scheming and clever but bad men,
who were the leaders in all mischief, known frequently as “sea lawyers,”
the sailor at sea is usually an industrious, thrifty, and, I may add, a
sober man. You will find him in the “dog watches,” or during the
Saturday-afternoon holidays, making, mending, or washing his clothes;
his trousers, his chief garment, are cut out from a roll of canvas
stretched on deck, by means of his jack knife, and usually consist of
only two pieces ingeniously stitched together; being, consequently, too
flat behind, but having the highly-approved and familiar straight legs.
He takes a particular interest in his sea-chest and its contents, and is
often to be found arranging them and seeing that they are all in good
order. As he approaches home, after a long voyage, you may see him
figuring with a bit of chalk on the lid of his chest the amount of wages
he will have to receive, and frequently hear him relating to his shipmates
how he intends to dispose of them, and his mental disposition of
them is usually wise and generous. But, as soon as he goes on shore,
his character seems to change, and there he too frequently throws his
hard-earned wages away in drink, folly, and vice. I had, when a
youth, seen something of the sailor in his usual rendezvous on shore as
well as at sea, but nothing good or evil that I remember worthy of note.
Therefore, when changes relating to his condition and welfare were
contemplated, and when, as a member of the House of Commons, it was
likely that I should be expected to aid in effecting those changes, I
resolved to see more of Jack on shore than I had ever done before.
With that object, I frequently dressed in the rough garb of a coasting
skipper or mate. I might have saved myself the trouble of changing
my usual attire, for few knew me then in person, and, at best, I never
looked better than the character I assumed. Thus attired, I made
frequent nightly visits to the public-houses and dancing saloons in
Ratcliffe Highway, and in the vicinity of the London and St. Katherine’s
Docks, the usual haunts of sailors and of their varied and very questionable
“friends.” With my pipe and pint of beer, I sat often for hours
among them, and thoroughly made myself master of “Jack on shore”
and of his depraved companions. Poor fellow! he was, so long as his
money lasted, the victim of them all. Sometimes the whole of his earnings
were lost or stolen from him in the first night’s debauch. As you
entered these gaudy but wretched saloons, you could at once distinguish
in the throng the sailor who had just come on shore, and the
sailor out-of-elbows in search of another ship. I shall not attempt to
describe these places, of which there are still too many in the East end
of London; it is sufficient to state that vice in its darkest forms, without
one redeeming spark, held high revel there. They were, indeed,
loathsome “hells.” I gained from them, however, a knowledge which I
could not otherwise have obtained, and which I hope proved of some
service to the Board of Trade when they were framing their excellent
measures for the improvement of our mercantile marine.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_169" href="#FNanchor_169" class="label">[169]</a> During the year ending 20th November, 1874, 50,182<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> was
received at the Seaman’s Savings-banks, and 45,964<i>l.</i> 9<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> paid away,
leaving to the credit of the seamen depositors, with interest, 81,116<i>l.</i> 1<i>s</i>.
Since the money-order offices were opened in 1855, there has been
received through these offices at ports in the United Kingdom and ports
abroad, up to the close of 1874, 4,827,093<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>, and remitted to
804,208 persons the sum of 4,822,338<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> 8<i>d</i>. See Parl. Papers, Seaman’s
Savings-banks and Money-orders, 161, 21st April, 1875. I most
sincerely trust that Government will do everything in its power to
encourage and induce seamen to make more use than they now do of
these most valuable offices. These and education, more than stringent
legislative enactments, are the instruments whereby the power of the
crimp is to be crushed, and our seamen elevated to the position of our
mechanics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Repeal of

<p>The spring of 1852 ushered in the dawn of brighter
days for the disconsolate and “ruined” British shipowner:
he could then, at least, obtain, with prudent
management, a moderate remuneration on his capital,
but there was no actual scarcity of tonnage until 1854.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
Freights, as we have seen, had no doubt materially
risen in the interval, because we had hesitated to increase
the number of our ships, while foreigners, with
the exception of the Americans, had refrained from
rushing into the trade we had opened for them to
the alarming extent anticipated. Consequently, there
was, hardly, tonnage enough to meet the requirements
of commerce created by the abolition of our
Navigation Laws, still less to satisfy the sudden
demands which arose when, in March 1854, England
and France declared war against Russia. Suitable
vessels could not then be found in sufficient numbers
to send forth, with the requisite despatch, the
allied armies and their supplies to the scene of action;
nor, I must add, could British seamen be obtained
to man with expedition our ships of war. Government,
therefore, threw open our Coasting trade, and
repealed the once famous manning clause, which,
however, neither increased, on the average, the number
of foreigners we had hitherto been allowed to
employ in our ships, nor deteriorated the number
and quality of British seamen, though aiding, at the
time, the more expeditious equipment of our fleets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Government
refuses
to
issue
letters of
marque.</div>

<p>But a much more important step affecting the interests
of maritime commerce and the progress of
mankind was taken in 1854. On the declaration of
that unfortunate war, her Majesty in Council, in
order to preserve the commerce of neutrals from
unnecessary obstruction, waived the belligerent rights
appertaining to the Crown by the law of nations, by
declining to issue letters of marque or by confiscating
neutral property on board of Russian ships, or neutral
ships with Russian property on board, provided such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
goods were not contraband of war. She, however,
reserved the right of blockade; a reservation by
which I may remind my readers, her Majesty’s
subjects were, commercially, by far the greatest
sufferers.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Great increase
of
ship-building
and
high
freights.</div>

<p>The extraordinary demands for shipping on the
outbreak of war led to their production with still
more extraordinary rapidity, and furnished, at the
same time, the most convincing proofs that we
had within ourselves resources far beyond all other
nations for meeting the emergency of war, without
the necessity of keeping up a large and expensive
standing navy, especially as such a navy must always
be in a state of transition. The high rates of freight
then offered for transports, ranging from 20<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i>
a register-ton per month for sailing vessels, and from
35<i>s.</i> to 65<i>s.</i> per gross register-ton for steamers,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> produced
not merely all the vessels required for our own
transport service,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> but, also, for the wants of France,
whose armies without our aid could not have been
conveyed to the Crimea.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span></p>

<p>With such rapidity, indeed, were sailing ships
produced, that the supply not merely soon overtook,
but greatly exceeded the demand; the consequence,
of course, being a great reaction in prices. Steam-vessels,
in the construction of which there had been a
large amount of speculation, likewise felt ere long
the depression, and before the close of 1855 the rates
for these had fallen to 40<i>s.</i> and 35<i>s.</i> per ton per
month: the surplus steamers, however, found their
way, in the end, to the advantage of all concerned,
into trades formerly carried on by sailing vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reaction.</div>

<p>Although the Russian war had created at first an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
unusual demand for vessels of every description, and
had given an extraordinary impulse to ship-building,
prudent shipowners soon foresaw that so sudden a
rush of prosperity could not long endure without as
sudden a revulsion, and “that it was fallacious to
suppose that the same demand would continue even
while the war lasted.”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Transport
service.</div>

<p>Nor was it less apparent that the number of vessels
engaged by Government exceeded what was <i>actually</i>
required for the prosecution of the war, and that, if
hostilities continued, the number would be materially
reduced as soon as something like an organised
system had been established.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Such, indeed, proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
to be the case; for, when a temporary Transport
Board was appointed, various vessels were discharged,
and the rates of freight for sailing ships, which had
averaged 1<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> per ton, fell to 15<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> per ton.
Indeed, there can be no doubt that, had there been
a well-organised board in operation when war was
declared, the sea transport service, which cost this
country 15,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling during that brief and
unhappy war, would have been far more efficiently
conducted for two-thirds that amount.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span></p>
<p>Great and unusual depression naturally followed
the cessation of hostilities. Although wars and famines,
however unfortunate and disastrous to the
nation, afford rich sources of emolument to shipowners,
the adverse reaction is frequently sudden and
severe. Before the close of 1857, our markets had
become so overstocked with vessels of every kind, that
it was hardly possible to obtain for them, in any
branch of trade, remunerative freights.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Depression
in the
United
States.</div>

<p>Nor were the Shipowners of the United States in
any better position. They, too, had overbuilt themselves.
Their exclusive Californian trade had offered
so many inducements, and, in fact, such large fortunes
had been realised out of it, that many more vessels
than could be profitably employed were built in the
Northern States between 1849 and 1854. Some of
these were placed on the trade with Europe. A very
large amount of capital had been invested in the
famous ships thus employed; but even these, before
the close of 1854, were becoming unremunerative,
owing to the competition of British iron screw-steamers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
which I shall very fully describe hereafter,
as they were the main weapon, whereby we bade
defiance to the competition of all other nations, in the
general ocean race then just commenced. As these
splendid iron ships soon commanded all the passenger
traffic, and, at the same time, secured the preference
by shippers of high-classed and valuable goods,
which could afford to pay the heaviest rates of freight,
many of the American clippers were obliged to seek
employment elsewhere. As the <i>Great Republic</i><a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
was one of the finest, as well as the largest of these
famous vessels—indeed, she was the largest <i>sailing</i>
vessel in the world, I furnish an illustration of her at
page 360. But though this vessel and a large number
of the American liners found temporary employment
in the French transport service, they on the cessation
of hostilities were obliged to seek employment elsewhere;
and, so great was the depression, that American
shipowners, in 1857, suffered quite as much as did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>the generality of those persons who owned sailing
vessels in Great Britain. Indeed, on the 1st January
of the following year, there was not a single vessel
building on the stocks of New York for the mercantile
marine, and, for many months previously, the shipbuilders
throughout the United States had been at a
complete standstill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disastrous
years of
1857 and
1858.</div>

<p>But all branches of trade throughout the world
were now suffering to a greater or less extent, and
1857 and 1858 will long be remembered as gloomy
years. The outbreak of the mutiny in India, the
consequent suspension of remittances from the East,
and the demand for specie, together with an uninterrupted
outflow of the precious metals to the Continent,
led to an alarming drain of the bullion in the
Bank of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Many
banks stop
payment.</div>

<p>After a long struggle to maintain cash payments
without pressing unduly on the mercantile classes, the
rate of discount rose so high as to render necessary,
for the second time, the temporary suspension of the
Bank Charter Act of 1844. The effect of this twice-repeated
measure was disastrous to many merchants
engaged in the trade of the United States; not a few
of whom were obliged to suspend payment. The
stoppage of the Northumberland and Durham district
Bank, with liabilities amounting to 3,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling;
as well as those of the Western Bank of Scotland,
which had been engaged in wild speculations
in the United States and elsewhere, with liabilities to
the extent of 8,911,000<i>l.</i>, and that also of the City of
Glasgow Bank for 6,000,000<i>l.</i>, tended materially to
increase the depression.</p>

<p>The Liverpool Borough Bank, which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
previously drained by the insolvency of various
mushroom speculators in ships, failed for 5,000,000<i>l.</i>,
and the Wolverhampton Bank followed for 1,000,000<i>l.</i>
Many private mercantile firms, also, whose liabilities
alone were variously computed at a sum not far short
of 20,000,000<i>l.</i>, were, at the same period, obliged to
suspend payment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shipowners’
Society

their
failures to
the repeal
of the
Navigation
Laws.</div>

<p>Through such overwhelming disasters, it was
hardly to be expected that the Shipowners of Great
Britain would pass unscathed, especially after the
prosperity they had enjoyed during the Crimean War.
Nevertheless, the General Shipowners’ Society of
London, in the report of the annual meeting, held on
the 25th June, 1858, does not appear to have attributed
the cause of the depression under which Shipowners
were suffering to the revulsion in commercial
affairs. On the contrary, they still held the strange delusion,
that, so far as they were concerned, the repeal
of our Navigation Laws, together with the absence of
reciprocity on the part of foreign nations, were the
main causes of suffering: curiously enough, too, the
report attributed some portion of their misfortunes
to the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854, and the
Passenger Act of the following year.</p>

<p>Having thus, as they conceived, ample grounds for
an appeal to Government, they, like the frogs before
Jupiter, made an effort to induce Lord Derby, their
great friend and patron, and then Prime Minister,
to relieve their depressed fortunes.</p>

<p>Nor was this agitation for relief confined to the
Shipowners’ Society of London. Aberdeen, Dundee,
Newcastle, Shields, and various other ports on the
north-east coast, where, perhaps, foreign competition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
was most severely felt, sent in petitions to Parliament;
while numerous pamphlets appeared in which
the ostensible cause of the Shipowners’ suffering was
duly set forth. We had the old stories retold of
the huge Yankee ships eating up all their profits
in the Indian trade, told, too, at a time when
American shipowners were suffering quite as much
as themselves. Nor did the authors of these pamphlets
fail to remind us of our old hobgoblins, the
Swedes and Norwegians, who, faring sumptuously
on “black-bread,” were carrying all before them
in the Northern Seas and in the Mediterranean, to
the irretrievable ruin of the hapless British shipowners.</p>

<p>Such tales of sorrow from the outports, including
Liverpool, Glasgow, and those on the west coast
of Scotland, where not a few of these “ruined” men
had realised handsome fortunes during the Crimean
War, made a deep impression on the bosom of the
General Shipowners’ Society of London, whose hearts
had been softened by their own “losses.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> They, too,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>as we have seen, entirely coincided with their brethren
of the outports as to the cause of the depression: and,
while it was resolved to continue pouring in the
petitions to Parliament expressive of their views and
praying for relief, and, also, to stir up an agitation
through the medium of pamphlets and that portion
of the press which entertained similar opinions to
their own, it was likewise considered desirable to
make a combined effort by the means of a public
meeting to be held in London, so that their sufferings
and their wrongs might become generally
known among all classes of the community.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meeting
of Shipowners,
December
15th, 1858.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Their
proposal.</div>

<p>This meeting was consequently held at the London
Tavern on the 15th December, 1858. The chairman,
however, Mr. Duncan Dunbar, then one of the greatest
individual shipowners in the kingdom, in opening the
proceedings, declared that no idea was entertained of
asking for a reversal of recent legislation, the delegates
from the outports having previously come to
the resolution to limit their demands to the consideration
of the question of reciprocity, praying the
Crown at the same time to put in motion the clauses
of the Navigation Repeal Act, which authorize the
Queen to retaliate on such foreign Powers as should
refuse reciprocity, and to place the ships of these
countries on, as nearly as possible, the same footing
as that in which British ships are placed in the ports
of such country.</p>

<p>Volumes of statistics were brought forward by
Mr. George Frederick Young, who appeared as chief
spokesman, and, as heretofore, the undaunted champion
of his party, to show that, though British shipping
had increased since the repeal of the Navigation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
Laws, foreign vessels frequenting our ports had done
so in a far greater proportion. Mr. Young repudiated
the idea—the “delusion”—that consumers were benefited
by the reduction of freight to the full extent of
the difference which must exist between the sum paid
to the English carrier and the rate of freight paid to
his foreign competitor; and concluded his remarks by
a resolution to the effect that the existing “most
deplorable and ruinous depression” had been partly
caused, and was greatly aggravated by the unequal
competition to which British shipping was exposed
by the repeal of the Navigation Laws. Other speakers
from Liverpool, Glasgow, Hull, Shields, Montrose,
Dundee, and Aberdeen described the state of affairs
in their several localities; and, finally, a petition to
the Queen was agreed on, recapitulating the progress
of legislation on the Navigation Laws, and
alleging that the apprehensions entertained when
that measure passed were fully verified by the
result.</p>

<p>Similar meetings were held in various other parts
of the country, including Tynemouth and North
Shields, which I then represented, and a wish was
intimated to me from those places that I should
bring the state of the shipping interest under the
notice of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Although I entertained very different views to
those expressed at these meetings, I felt, nevertheless,
that our Shipowners had many just causes
for complaint; and that, though it was now alike
beyond the power of the Legislature to control the
rising destinies of other and rival nations, or even
confine their mercantile marine within the narrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
limits prescribed by our jealousy, so as to remove
all dread of foreign competition, there were
yet many burdens from which they ought to be relieved,
and many restrictions, to which they would
never have been subjected by the State, had it not
been considered that they derived peculiar benefits
from the laws so long enforced for their supposed
advantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Lindsay
moves
for a Committee
of
Inquiry.</div>

<p>Accordingly I moved for a committee “to inquire
into the operation of certain burdens specially affecting
merchant shipping,” which after an interesting
debate the House was pleased to grant.</p>

<p>But the committee had scarcely assembled when
Parliament was dissolved, and it was not until a new
Parliament had met, that the subject was again
brought under the notice of the House of Commons.
In the meantime the Shipowners’ Society of London
had urged Government, in a letter of the 22nd
February, 1859, for a reply to their petition praying
the Queen to exercise the powers vested in her, and
to put in force the retaliatory clause of the Repeal
Act of 1849.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Well-drawn
petition
of the
Shipowners.</div>

<p>This petition, I must state, was short and exceedingly
well drawn. It gracefully avoided all matters of
detail and controversy; the petitioners approached
her Majesty, “animated by the most profound sentiments
of loyalty,” for which, indeed, I must add the
Shipowners of the United Kingdom have ever been
conspicuous; they represented “the ruinous state of
depression” into which their interest was “plunged,”
and they “implored” her Majesty “to be pleased to
extend to that important national interest such assistance
and relief as her Majesty was enabled to afford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
to it through the exercise of those powers which
were vested by law in the Crown.”<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>The petition was signed by the chairman, Mr.
Dunbar, as representative of the meeting; by Mr.
George Marshall, as chairman of the General Shipowners’
Society; and by deputies from most of the
leading seaports of the kingdom. From the weight
and high character of the persons who had signed
this petition, Government could not do otherwise
than attach considerable importance to it, however
much they may have differed from the mode
of relief the memorialists prayed Her Majesty to
adopt. Indeed, the time had arrived when it was
desirable for Government to review the effects really
produced by the repeal of the Navigation Laws, and
to inquire into the burdens and restrictions to which
British Shipowners were still subjected. Nor was it
less necessary to direct attention to the state of foreign
legislation with regard to British shipping, since the
removal by us of all restrictions on the vessels of
foreign nations engaged in the trade of the United
Kingdom and her possessions. As the exposition of
the bearing of these questions, necessarily, furnishes
a complete insight into the Merchant Shipping of
the country at that period, it is my duty to furnish
the report of Government, if not in detail, at least
at greater length than I might otherwise have done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign
Governments
and the
amount
of their
reciprocity.</div>

<p>In this carefully considered document, it was, authoritatively,
announced that France, Spain, and Portugal,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>where partial restrictions on the ships of other
nations were still maintained, were the only foreign
Governments which had not extended complete reciprocity
to British ships so far as regards the foreign
oversea carrying trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French
trade.</div>

<p>In France, under the treaty of 1826, British and
French ships were on a footing of equality in the
direct trade between the two countries; but, in
the indirect foreign trade, in the colonial, and in the
coasting trades of that country, British ships still
laboured under serious disabilities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spanish
trade.</div>

<p>In Spain, British ships were placed on a footing of
equality with Spanish ships as regards all port and
navigation dues, by a Royal order of September,
1852, having been, previously, subjected to heavy
differential charges. But an excess of 20 per cent.
was still levied on goods imported in foreign ships in
the indirect trade, and, to this extent, British navigation
was still unfairly treated there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Portuguese
trade.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Belgian
trade.</div>

<p>Restrictions were also maintained in Portugal on
foreign ships in the indirect and colonial trades. In
addition to the case of the above three countries, it
must be also mentioned that, in Belgium, there was
still charged a duty of 1<i>s.</i> 1¼<i>d.</i> per 100 kilogrammes
on salt, when imported in British vessels, while in
Belgian and Sardinian ships this article was free.
But, in spite of this disability, the total tonnage of
the two countries, respectively, entered and cleared,
with cargoes or in ballast, in the direct trade, was,
in 1857, only 143,341 tons, while the British shipping
employed in it that year amounted to upwards of
364,000 tons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British
ships in
French
and
Spanish
ports.</div>

<p>It was admitted that the pursuance of this restrictive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
policy would fully justify retaliation, more especially
in the case of France and Spain; but the results exhibited
in the appended Return<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> show that the trade
transferable, by any such measure, from foreign to
British ships was comparatively so small, as neither
to operate as an inducement to the countries in question
to relax their present system, nor to afford any
material addition to British shipping. Another Return,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
also, showing the total amount of British tonnage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>which entered and cleared in French and Spanish
ports respectively in the indirect trade in each year,
from 1853 to 1857 inclusive, proves, to how small an
extent, the shipping of these countries engaged in the
indirect trade with the United Kingdom; the result
being, that, in spite of the unequal restrictions, there
was a larger amount of British tonnage employed in
the indirect trade with those countries, than of the
tonnage of such countries, respectively, in the indirect
trade of the United Kingdom, to which they were
admitted on equal terms with British ships. Further,
the accounts accessible in Portugal, however imperfect,
were sufficient to afford conclusive evidence that
the British flag in no respect suffered from the competition
of that country. Indeed, the total tonnage
of Portuguese ships which entered and cleared in the
direct and indirect trades of the United Kingdom in
1857 was only 56,606 tons, whereas the British
tonnage employed in the direct trade alone with
Portugal amounted in the same year to 234,423
tons.</p>

<p>If a comparison were made between the relative employment
of British and French tonnage in the whole
trade of France and the United Kingdom, respectively,
direct as well as indirect, it would appear that,
in 1857, the total amount of British tonnage in
French ports was equal to two-thirds of the French
tonnage in its own ports; while, in the same year,
the total French tonnage in British ports was, of
course, in a very small proportion, indeed, to the
amount of British tonnage in British ports, and considerably
less than one-half of the amount of British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
tonnage at French ports. Similar results were shown
in the case of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coasting
trade.</div>

<p>Previously to the opening<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> of the coasting trade
of the United Kingdom, British ships were admitted
on equal terms with the National ships in the coasting
trades of Hanover, Belgium, Oldenburg, Mecklenburg,
Holland, Turkey (except foreign steamers
for the Bosphorus), Monte Video, Paraguay, New
Granada, and China. But, in consequence of that
measure, the coasting trades of Norway and Sweden,
Denmark, Prussia, Sardinia, and Tuscany were, likewise,
opened to British ships on the same footing as
national vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Non-reciprocating
countries.</div>

<p>The coasting trade, however, of the following
countries was still withheld from British ships, and
reserved for the national flag, viz., France, Papal
States, Two Sicilies, Russia, Austria, Spain, Portugal,
Greece, United States of America (as regards
goods), Mexico, Peru, Chili, Brazil, La Plata, Venezuela,
and Hayti.</p>

<p>As in the case of foreign trade, the Queen, in the
exercise of the powers vested in her, might, doubtless,
with perfect justice, exclude the shipping of
these countries from the coasting trade of the United
Kingdom; but, in this branch of trade, even more
than in that of foreign trade, such a measure would
have proved almost wholly valueless to the shipping
of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The tonnage of each foreign State, engaged in
the coasting trade of the United Kingdom in the
year 1857 was absolutely insignificant, and, for all
practical purposes, is still virtually monopolised by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
British shipping.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> It will be observed that, both in
the foreign and in the coasting trades, the countries
which have reciprocated the liberal policy of the
United Kingdom are those which have most benefited
by the repeal of our restrictions, while the countries
which continue to maintain unequal restrictions on
British ships, and against which, alone, any measure
of retaliation could have been directed, are those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>which have derived little or no advantage from the
opening of British trade.</p>

<p>There is one other case noticed in the Board of
Trade Report to which it is desirable again to advert,
in considering the question of reciprocity, as this
case has been made the subject of frequent complaint,
viz., the exclusion of British ships from the trade
between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of the United
States of America.</p>

<p>The Government of that country has reserved, as
we have seen, this trade to the national flag. In
this report it is stated that they have done so, on the
ground of its being a Coasting trade; and that they
are supported, by analogy, in several other countries
under similar geographical conditions: for example,
the trade between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean
coasts of France and Spain.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> And, further,
that, with reference to the technical difficulty, it
would not be competent for the Queen, under the
retaliatory clauses alluded to, to exclude United States
ships from any branch of British trade, except the
coasting trade of the United Kingdom; and it had
been shown that the share of this trade enjoyed
by the United States was so small, that such a measure
could neither injure the United States nor benefit
British shipping.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Presumed
advantage
of the
Panama
route.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span></p>
<p>It was thought, moreover, that the value of this
branch of trade on the American coast had been
greatly overrated. In the first place, it was obvious
that every year would diminish its importance if
the surmise was correct that the bulk of the trade
between the two sea-boards of the North American
continent would shortly be carried across the Isthmus
of Panama, and would thus, be placed at the disposal
of British ships.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Question
discussed.</div>

<p>Whatever opinion may be formed concerning the
validity of this comparison, the Board of Trade
assured the Shipowners that the Queen’s Government
had held on this question, that, although the inter-Oceanic
trade of the United States might, in a strictly
technical sense, be properly defined as a Coasting
trade,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> yet, on the broad ground of international
equity, it should rather be regarded as analogous to
the trade between the United Kingdom and her
distant dependencies, and that British ships were,
therefore, fairly entitled to participate in the former,
in return for the complete assimilation of the United
States to the British flag in the latter field of profitable
employment.</p>

<p>It should, however, be remarked that, with reference
to this question, the reservation of the coasting
trade to national vessels does not appear to apply to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>the carriage of passengers; so that, as far as can be
ascertained, foreign vessels lie under no disability in
the transport of passengers coastwise from port to
port of the United States of America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Was the
depression
due to
the withdrawal
of
Protection?</div>

<p>It remains now to inquire how far such depression
can be, in truth, attributed to the withdrawal of protection
from British shipping, and to the consequent
unrestricted competition with the shipping of other
countries; for it is, only, by an examination into
general results, that any satisfactory conclusions
upon this question can be arrived at.</p>

<p>Now it is inseparable from the nature of all great
changes of system that particular interests must, occasionally,
suffer from causes which contribute to the
general good; it is, therefore, possible in this instance,
that particular trades may have been injuriously
affected, while the general interests of British
shipping have been promoted.</p>

<p>The statistical accounts of British tonnage employed
at any given time afford a very imperfect test
of the actual condition of the shipping interest, the
more so as shipping is often employed with very
inadequate remuneration; but this remark does not
apply to periods of time extending over several
years; hence, the shipping returns of the nine years
since the repeal of the Navigation Laws may be
fairly held to supply sufficient evidence of the influence
that measure has exercised on the permanent
interests of British shipping.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Board of
Trade
report
and
returns.</div>

<p>Consequently a table was prepared by the Board
of Trade to show the total aggregate tonnage of
British and foreign vessels, respectively, entered and
cleared, with cargoes and in ballast, at ports of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
United Kingdom in each year from 1842 to 1857
inclusive, a period comprehending eight years before
and eight years after the repeal of the Navigation
Laws.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">English
and
foreign
tonnage.</div>

<p>It will be seen from this table that during the first
period British tonnage advanced from 6,699,995 tons
in 1842 to 9,669,638 in 1849, being an increase of
2,969,643 tons.</p>

<p>In the second period it advanced from 9,442,544 tons
in 1850 to 13,694,107 tons in 1857, being an increase
of 4,251,563 tons.</p>

<p>In the same period the progress in the employment
of foreign tonnage in the trade of the United Kingdom
has been from 1842, 2,457,479 tons; to 1849,
4,334,750 tons; increase 1,877,271 tons. From 1850,
5,062,520 tons; to 1857, 9,484,685 tons; increase
4,422,165 tons.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, that these tables only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>show the state of the trades before the repeal was
completely carried out for British and, partially so, to
foreign ships, and that, in order to estimate the full
effect of the measure on British shipping, it is necessary,
also, to show the number of British ships built
and registered during the respective periods.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>There are two features in these returns deserving
special notice.</p>

<p>1st. According to the opinion of the Board of
Trade this account shows a larger relative increase
than that of the previous returns relating to the
employment of tonnage, while it, at the same time,
confirms the hypothesis that many British ships now
find an employment in the indirect trade of foreign
countries, which, of course, does not appear in the
accounts rendered in England. Indeed, during the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>period of protection, there was an actual decrease in
the amount of tonnage built and registered, while a
large increase took place in the second period of open
competition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sailing
vessels
and
steamers
in home
and
foreign
trades.</div>

<p>The next account shows the number and tonnage
of registered sailing and steam vessels of the United
Kingdom employed in the home and foreign trades
respectively (<i>excluding repeated voyages</i>).<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>On this return it is to be observed that there has
been a greater progress in the tonnage engaged
in the foreign trade, where competition exists, than
in the home trade, where, although that competition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>is also allowed by law, it is only carried out to a
trifling extent in practice, the latter having only
advanced from 719,815 to 860,406 tons, while the
former has advanced from 2,089,037 to 3,168,105.</p>

<p>It now remains to consider the shipping accounts
for 1858.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> These exhibited a decline as compared
with those of the preceding years, and to this extent
gave indications of the depression of which Shipowners
so much complained.</p>

<p>The accounts of December 1858 and January 1859,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
if taken separately, showed that a favourable reaction
had already commenced, and that British shipping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>was, in the spring of 1859, recovering from the depression
it had suffered; and this fact was, naturally,
much dwelt on by the champions of repeal, confirming,
as it was supposed to do, the opinion expressed
on the temporary and accidental character of this depression.
This account, also, illustrates the state of
the merchant shipping of England at a period preceding
a continental war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign
and
Colonial
trades.</div>

<p>It was pointed out with a certain degree of
triumph, that these three accounts, when taken together,
afforded satisfactory evidence that, down to
the close of 1857, the progress of British shipping
had suffered no check nor reverse, and that the great
development of the foreign tonnage, employed in the
trade of the United Kingdom during recent years,
was only partly attributable to the repeal of the Navigation
Laws in 1849, the progress of foreign shipping
in British trade having been nearly as rapid in
the period of eight years prior to 1850 in consequence
of the increasing requirements of British
commerce.</p>

<p>The reason of the decline exhibited in the accounts
for 1858 must, therefore, be sought from other causes;
and, probably, the commercial history of the previous
few years is amply sufficient to afford the required
explanation; moreover, any loss we might, thereby,
have sustained was more than counterbalanced by
the extraordinary development of the foreign and
colonial trades of the United Kingdom during the
ten years preceding 1859.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Probable
causes of
the depression
in England
and
America.</div>

<p>The commercial crisis, however, which occurred on
both sides of the Atlantic, at the close of 1857, necessarily
operated injuriously upon the progress of
English trade, and consequently on English shipping.
It must be also remembered that the Russian war,
and, subsequently, the disturbances in British India,
created a large and <i>abnormal</i> demand for tonnage,
which ceased with the termination of those temporary
causes; and, as tonnage employed exclusively
in the Government transport service, does not appear
in the preceding account, it is probable that, during
1858, there was a still greater check to the demand
for tonnage than is therein expressed.</p>

<p>The temporary depression was, however, by no
means confined to the shipping of the United
Kingdom, as we have shown; similar symptoms
had manifested themselves in other maritime countries.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">American
jealousy
and competition.</div>

<p>Although the competition of British shipping in
steam navigation had been the subject of loud complaint
in America, it will be found that the decline in
the building and employment of British shipping in
1858 was not so great in proportion as that which
was indicated by the annual accounts of the imports
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>and exports of the United Kingdom for that
year.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Inconclusive
reasoning
of Board
of Trade.</div>

<p>The Board of Trade argued, but very inconclusively,
with reference to the free supply of foreign tonnage
for the requirements of British trade, that if, during
the exceptional circumstances of recent years, British
commerce had been obliged to depend on British
shipping alone to the extent which was necessary
before 1850, an artificial stimulus would have been
given to the demand for British ships, which could not
have been sustained, and that, therefore, the whole
weight of the reaction would have fallen upon British
shipping, instead of being diffused, as was the case,
among the whole tonnage employed in British trade.</p>

<p>Upon this preposterous conclusion no argument
can be raised: as well might it be said that a man
ought not to be individually prosperous, lest the
revulsion of adversity should be too great for him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>especially if not diffused among his rivals in trade.
At last, Government arrived at this conclusion about
the condition of merchant shipping, that they could
not attribute the actual depression of British shipping
to the effects of increased competition with foreign
shipping consequent on the repeal of the Navigation
Laws; but that, considering the importance of the
shipping interest in a national point of view, it was
desirable that all partial and unequal burdens to
which the shipping interest was still subject should
be removed as soon as practicable. In this spirit, the
repeal of the differential duty on foreign timber as
the raw material of shipbuilding, and the abolition
of passing tolls and other local burdens, which were
still maintained without any equivalent in the shape
of services rendered to shipping, were questions
which deserved immediate consideration.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that this very elaborate exposition
of the state of merchant shipping completely
cut the ground from under those Shipowners who
still advocated Protection. They, however, went on
cavilling “for a principle,” and contended that the
Spanish and French trades for instance might become
valuable to the British Shipowner if the Governments
of France and Spain would adopt the liberal policy
pursued by England towards them in this respect;
whereas, under the existing restrictions, British Shipowners
lost many valuable charters, and were prevented
from completing voyages otherwise profitable.
The Shipowners refused to allow the validity of the
argument, that the British Shipowner carried on a
greater business in the indirect trade with France
and Spain than the French and Spanish Shipowners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
in the indirect trade with England, and that, therefore,
retaliation would neither operate as an inducement
to those countries to relax their system, nor
afford material addition to the field of employment
of British shipping. They contended that the commercial
navy of this country was larger than that of
France and Spain combined; that, therefore, the
Shipowners of these countries had not the means of
engaging in an oversea trade to the same extent as
the Shipowners of England, and that, consequently,
the superior energy of the British Shipowner ought
not be pleaded as a barrier to an act of justice. Nor
did it, in their opinion, follow that, because the engagement
of the Spaniard and Frenchman in the
indirect trade with England was not larger and more
active than that of the British Shipowners in the
indirect trade with France and Spain, there was no
inducement to the Governments of those countries
to relax the present restrictive system, and no prospect,
in the event of such relaxation, of increased
employment of British shipping in the direction
indicated. In fact, the London Shipowners thought
the argument was entirely the other way, and would
not be convinced to the contrary, whatever relative
prosperity they might enjoy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Real value
of the
Coasting
trade of
the United
States.</div>

<p>With regard to the Coasting trade, all parties were
agreed that the Americans acted selfishly in denying
to England the same reciprocity for the coasting
trade, which she had unrestrictedly conceded to
them. The Shipowners, however, by no means acquiesced
in the opinion given by the Board of Trade,
that “the value of the American Coasting trade had
been greatly overestimated.” They said, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
reason, that it was an error to imagine that because
San Francisco formed the limit of the United States’
coasting trade, the entrances and clearances at that
port exhibited the entire amount of the trade along
the American seaboard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magnanimity
of
England
in throwing
open
her Coasting
trade
unconditionally
not appreciated
by
the Americans.</div>

<p>It was, indeed, an evasion to say that the American
coasting trade, meaning the western coast only,
never afforded employment to more than 200,000
tons of American ships. The records of these pages
afford proofs to the contrary. All mention of the
trade between the ports of the Northern States and
those of the Gulf of Mexico is, for some reason or
other, suppressed. All the vast and lucrative carrying
trade between New York and Boston, New
Orleans and Mobile and Charleston, is studiously kept
out of view; trades far more valuable than that of San
Francisco and of the whole western coast, collectively.
The argument, therefore, set up by the Board of
Trade, “that the participation of the Californian
trade, however desirable, cannot be regarded as a
circumstance which could exercise any important influence
on the shipping interests of Great Britain,”
was altogether unsatisfactory. Magnanimous as it
was of the English Legislature to throw open the
foreign, as well as the colonial commerce and navigation
of the Empire, and the coasting trade afterwards,
without imposing any previous conditions, such
a liberal policy has, evidently, been unappreciated
by the Americans, who seem resolved to monopolise
all advantages resulting from their geographical position.</p>

1st of January, 1855, while it produced great improvement in the
models of our ships, had the important advantage of creating very
little difference in the gross tonnage of the Empire, on which so many
dues are levied, and thus rendered unnecessary any change in the long-established
scale of charges, which in many cases would have been
altogether impracticable. For instance, 1100 vessels, large and small,
which were taken promiscuously, measuring under the old law 248,842
tons, were found under the new law to measure 231,277 tons, showing
a difference of only 7 per cent.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_173" href="#FNanchor_173" class="label">[173]</a> My own firm had somewhere about 100,000 tons of shipping (a large
proportion of which consisted of steam-vessels) under our management
engaged as transports for the Government of France. It was then that
I for the first time met the Emperor. I had occasion to visit Marseilles
with regard to the fitting of some of these ships, and, on my return
to Paris, I had an interview with Marshal Vaillant, the then Minister
of War, which led to an audience with his Majesty. I daresay the
Emperor had sent for me to confirm, or otherwise, certain calculations of
his own which he had been making as to the number of ships requisite
to transport a given number of men, and so forth; for, after a long
audience, I remarked at parting, “Sire, you had no need to send for
me, as you know more about ships and their capacity than I do.” The
fact is, he was thoroughly master of the subject, and could tell me to a
man the number of troops to be placed on a given ship, and to an
animal the number of horses a ship of 1000 tons could or should carry
from Marseilles to Kaemish; the space required for each, and for their
fodder and water, the height of deck requisite to allow for the <i>toss of
the head</i>; and the important, but not generally known fact, that
though a horse must feel its own weight on its own legs at sea, it must
also be slung, for if it lie down the chances are that it will not be able to
get up again. At least, if the Emperor did not know all about these
things when I entered the Tuileries, he was the most apt scholar I
ever met, for he knew all about them before I left. I mention this
circumstance because this audience, subsequently, enabled me to render
some assistance in a matter of far greater importance to both France
and England and to mankind, to which I shall hereafter refer, viz.:
the change in the French navigation laws, which is more to the purpose
of this work, than the transport of troops and horses to a field of
slaughter.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_175" href="#FNanchor_175" class="label">[175]</a> When war was declared, the greater portion of the work of engaging
transports devolved upon the Civil Lord of the Admiralty; and though,
perhaps, few men could have been found more competent for the
duty than Captain (now Admiral Sir Alexander) Milne, who then filled
that office, it was impossible for any one man to get through the work
he was expected to do, especially with the system, or rather want of
all system, which then prevailed. From my knowledge of what took
place, I have no hesitation in saying that everything relating to the
engagement of the requisite number of ships, and to the transport
of troops and stores to the Crimea, was a huge chaos; and I fear some
serious disaster would have ensued had the pluck and genius of the
nation not come to the rescue in the mode of conducting affairs at
home, as well as, so far as I could ascertain, in the field of action abroad.
At home, there was certainly no organisation, so far as regards the
transport service, or, at best, it was of the most imperfect description.
Stores were shipped without bills of parcels, and, frequently, without
bills of lading; and the current stories, at the time, of the shipload of
boots and shoes which lay at anchor in Balaclava harbour unknown to
our authorities, while the troops were bootless and shoeless; of the tops
of mess tables sent to the Crimea without the legs, and of the guns
without carriages, were no exaggerations. The Admiralty, it is true,
were responsible for the transport of the troops; but the Civil Lord, by
whom it was represented, had no control over shipments by either
the Ordnance or by the Medical Departments. A case came under my
own knowledge which would be ludicrous were it not melancholy.
One day, when I had occasion to visit a transport which lay at
Woolwich, two gentlemen, when I stepped on board, were wrangling
over the main hatchway. One was from the Ordnance, the other
was evidently in charge of certain medical stores which, with piles of
shot and shell, lay on the wharf ready for shipment. The shot and
shell representative insisted on having his goods in the centre compartment
of the vessel because they were heavy; the other gentleman
was as determined to have his physic stored in the same division of the
ship because it was perishable. Each would have his own way; and, as
neither would give way, after an hour’s altercation, they, to the amazement
and horror of the mate of the ship, came to a compromise by
ordering the stores of both departments to be stowed in this one
favourite position! It is needless to state the result; I may just, however,
say that when the ship arrived at the Crimea it was found that
the shot and shell had played sad havoc with the medicine cases, and
that the floor of her centre compartment was strewed with fragments
of fragile cases, demolished physic bottles, and countless numbers of
squashed pill-boxes.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_176" href="#FNanchor_176" class="label">[176]</a> When the war ceased, the Transport Board was abolished, and the
mode of conducting this important branch of the public service reverted
pretty much to what it had been previously. The Admiralty
found ships for the transport of troops at home and to our colonies
abroad, but a board at the India Office engaged vessels for all the troops
and stores to and from our possessions in the East, while other departments
had their own separate shipping offices; all of which, when
vessels were in demand, were <i>bidding against each other</i>, and also
against another department of the government, the Emigration Office.
The rates of freight were, of course, materially enhanced by this
unnecessary competition; and there would have been the same sad
story to tell as in the case of the Crimea, had we been unfortunately
involved in another war. Unable to obtain the necessary reform by
any other means, I, on the 5th of January, 1860, brought the existing
state of affairs under the notice of the House of Commons (see ‘Hansard,’
vol. clviii. pp. 2051-2061), when a committee was unanimously
appointed on my motion, “To inquire into the organisation and
management of those branches of the Admiralty, War Office, India
Office, and Emigration Board, by which the business of transporting,
by means of shipping, troops, convicts, emigrants, materials of war,
stores, and any other similar services, is now performed.” After a
diligent inquiry which lasted the whole session, the Committee did me
the honour to almost as unanimously adopt my report. But some time
elapsed before a permanent Transport Board was established, so
numerous were the obstacles, or rather prejudices, which had to be
overcome. That board is now, or ought to be, responsible for the conveyance
of all troops and Government stores from their embarkation
until landed at their port of destination.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_177" href="#FNanchor_177" class="label">[177]</a> The <i>Great Republic</i> belonged to the well-known mercantile firm of
Messrs. A. A. Law &amp; Co., of New York. When launched she registered
4000 tons; but, having unfortunately been partially destroyed by fire
shortly after she was built, her upper deck was removed, thus reducing
her size to 3400 tons. Her dimensions were 305 feet in length, fifty-three
feet extreme breadth, and thirty feet depth of hold. She was
fitted with double topsails, an American invention then rare in this
country, but now very common; she had on board a steam-engine of
eight horse-power for working ship, or loading and discharging cargo.
She brought 3000 tons of guano as “ballast” from New York to London,
and made the passage to the Scilly Islands in thirteen days, beating
up the English Channel thence against an easterly gale in three days to
the Downs. But, on her arrival in London, where she was consigned
to the care of my firm, I found she was much too large to be employed,
profitably, in any of the ordinary channels of commerce; and, had not
the French Government, then in want of transports for the Crimean
War, been induced, by the large space she afforded for the conveyance
of their troops, to engage her for this purpose, she must have
remained long after her arrival unemployed.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_178" href="#FNanchor_178" class="label">[178]</a> When I was a member of the House of Commons, there was a
great brewer, a most excellent man, who sat close to me on the cross
benches, who frequently complained of the heavy “losses” he sustained
in his trade. I was under the impression that the brewing trade was
a very lucrative one, especially to persons like himself, who conducted
it on a gigantic scale, and I was puzzled to understand how, in the
face of such “losses,” he could continue adding <i>vat</i> to <i>vat</i>, and rearing
fresh mountains of beer-barrels every year to his brewery yard. Turning
one night to a mutual friend who knew him more intimately than I
did, I asked, in the simplicity of my heart, if it <i>really</i> was the case that
the great establishment of which our friend was the senior was a losing
concern. “It is so,” he answered, “according to our friend’s way of
calculating; for every pound less than 75,000<i>l.</i> per annum, which is
estimated as his share of the net profits, is booked as <i>loss</i>!” Such must
also have been the way in which some of our large shipowners calculated
their “losses” after the repeal of the Navigation Laws.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_184" href="#FNanchor_184" class="label">[184]</a> I have great doubt whether the Board of Trade was justified in
making this statement. The Royal Decree of 10th December, 1852,
refers to a Law 9th July, 1841, which I have before me; but, when the
differential tonnage duty was abolished, the Gibraltar merchants presented
addresses thanking the authorities for the <i>restoration</i> of the flag.
The ports between the Garonne and the Bidassoa are, surely, not
under similar geographical conditions as either the ports or voyage
between the Hudson and the Columbia.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_185" href="#FNanchor_185" class="label">[185]</a> I really do not see it in that light. British ships would, indeed,
have a shorter voyage from England to California, but they would
still be precluded from going from New York to California <i>viâ</i> the
Canal or passage at the Isthmus. The restriction would continue and
would prove even more vexatious, as might be shown in a variety of
ways.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_186" href="#FNanchor_186" class="label">[186]</a> I deny this altogether. I cannot admit that a ship taking a cargo
from Cronstadt to Odessa, thus making almost the circumnavigation
of Europe, could be justly deemed to be making a <i>Coasting</i> voyage,
however much Russian municipal law might declare it to be so.</p>

<p>Besides the statistical returns supplied by the Board
of Trade on their report on the memorial of the
Shipowners to her Majesty, this Board, on the 25th
February, 1859, published further returns which
were seized upon by the Shipowners’ Association,
and made the basis for an energetic manifesto addressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
to the constituencies of the United Kingdom
at the general election in the spring of 1859.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
returns of
the Board
of Trade,</div>

<div class="sidenote">and address
of
the Shipowners’
Society
to the
electors,
April
13, 1859.</div>

<p>The returns in question consisted of five statements,
including the period from 1834 to 1858.
They are too voluminous to be given here, but it was
clear from them that, if the increase of the entrances
and clearances of British ships at the ports
of the United Kingdom, since the repeal of the
Navigation Laws, had been 3,221,767, the increase
of foreign ships on the other hand amounted to
5,083,826 tons. To these leading facts, the Shipowners’
Association, triumphantly, referred the different
constituencies, and, although British ships in
the eight years over which these returns extended,
had increased to a far greater extent than they had
in any similar previous period, the Association
pointed to the still greater increase of foreign shipping,
and implored the electors of the leading maritime
ports to send such representatives to the new
Parliament, who would be exponents of the opinions
they sought to perpetuate; and who would save British
Shipowners from the certain ruin in their opinion
awaiting them, as was so clearly demonstrated by the
“appalling” number of foreign ships frequenting
our ports. Pertinaciously adhering in this celebrated
manifesto to their extreme Protectionist principles,
they now reasserted with confidence, and with a brazen
front the more astonishing, after what they had previously
admitted, every doctrine that had proved
to be fallacious, every “fact” which had long since
been shown to have had its origin in the regions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>fancy or fiction, every appeal to be saved from
ruin as baseless as the shepherd’s wolf cry, and
every theory as visionary as their own fears; by
such means, hoping to revive a system, which the
Legislature and every class of the community, except
themselves, had pronounced to be neither wise, just,
nor beneficial. But, with these principles patent
to the whole world, fully confirmed, too, as they
were, by the extraordinary success resulting from
the repeal of the Navigation Laws, they kept
harping on the one string, that foreign shipping
entering and clearing from our ports had, since
that period, increased in a greater ratio than our
own, and this one fact produced to a large extent
the desired effect on the maritime portions of the
constituencies.</p>

<p>It was vain to tell them that, under the new
policy, we had increased our shipping to an extent
far beyond what had been hitherto accomplished;
or that the nation at large, by obtaining all it required
from foreign nations at materially reduced
rates, was greatly and proportionately benefited by
the change. Nor was it of any use to show that our
exports and imports, and, consequently, the general
wealth of the country, had already increased far
beyond the most sanguine hopes of even the Free-traders.
To attempt to prove to a maritime constituency
that the more intercourse we had with other
countries the better it would be for us, and that the
impoverishment of our neighbours by restrictive
laws was not the best means of enriching ourselves,
was then a mere waste of time, and all such arguments
were, at too many of our seaports, only received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
with scorn and ridicule. At all such places, the one
fact I have named carried the day. Among various
other seaport representatives who held Free-trade
principles, I lost my seat for the Tynemouth
boroughs; at least, I found such a phalanx of Shipowners
arrayed against me, that I should have had
a great struggle to retain it.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> However, within a
week, I found another seat at Sunderland, and,
though the bulk of the Shipowners there, too, were
opposed to my views, I was returned over my
Conservative opponent (the late George Hudson)
by a very large majority.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> But it fared, otherwise,
with many better men who lost their seats and did
not find others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span></p>

<p>The one fact in the Shipowners’ manifesto, apparently,
strengthened their cause in Parliament. I say
apparently, because though the new men were pledged
to vote for the removal of all “grievances” in the
shape of peculiar and special burdens and for “reciprocity,”
whatever that might mean, I question if any
one of them would have voted for a reversion of our
policy. It was idle to talk about it. “Protection
to native industry” was gone, and gone for ever!
England had adopted a policy which can never
be reversed. But the General Shipowners’ Society
of London, elated with success, resolved to make
one more determined effort to, at least, restore the
Colonial trade to the vessels of Great Britain, and
to induce Parliament to recommend her Majesty in
Council to exclude from our carrying trade the vessels
of those nations which did not reciprocate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shipowners’
meeting
in London.</div>

<p>With these objects in view, they invited to their
aid delegates from all the seaports in the kingdom,
and every person of influence in and out of Parliament
likely to aid their cause. Another public
meeting was held in the London Tavern, at which
Mr. R. W. Crawford, one of the members for the City,
took the chair. I had, unexpectedly, received an invitation
to attend, which I accepted, as the question
to be discussed, apart from my duty to my constituents,
was one in which I had a large personal
interest. Knowing, however, that few persons in
the vast assembly which had been got together
agreed with the view I entertained, I took my seat,
almost out of sight, in the rear of the platform. The
meeting was, indeed, one of a most influential character.
Many men were there whose cheque for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
10,000<i>l.</i> would have passed as freely as a 5<i>l.</i> note,
and whose hale and ruddy countenances did not at
all betoken that they were on “the road to ruin.”
Perhaps it was malicious on the part of the ‘Times’
to describe the meeting “as the largest collection of
political and commercial fossils which could be got
together in these adverse days for political antiquarianism;”
but it is quite true that their views,
generally, so far as they could be comprehended,
were certainly of an antiquarian character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of the
speeches
at it.</div>

<p>Mr. Frederick Somes, the member for Hull, who
moved the first resolution, declared “that nothing
but ruin could result to the shipping interest,” if
the existing policy was pursued; and Mr. Bramley-Moore,
who seconded it, stated that “the coasting trade
was gradually drifting into the hands of foreigners”
(a very extraordinary statement in the face of the
official returns), while he argued that, “we should have
the right of selling to, as well as purchasing from, the
foreigner,” as if any person or any law prevented
him from doing so if he pleased. Mr. George Marshall,
one of our largest and most intelligent shipowners,
spoke, from experience, of the depressed
state of British shipping, owing to the “inability to
compete with foreigners;” and Mr. Duncan Dunbar
told the meeting, but not in a doleful tone, for he
was the jolliest of men, with the happiest of countenances,
“that the very property he had made by
his industry and hard labour was melting away like
snow before the sun.”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span></p>
<p>It was hopeless to expect that the Legislature
would attempt to do anything, even if they could, for
a body of men who, representing a great national
interest, delivered such sentiments as these, and had,
evidently, assembled for the purpose of obliging other
people to make good any losses they might have
sustained, if any there were, during the two previous
years, while pocketing in silence, for their own special
benefit, the large profits they had secured during the
Crimean war. What had Government to do with the
profits and losses of Shipowners any more than it had
to do with those of any other branch of trade? Invited,
as I had been, to take part in these deliberations,
I felt that I should do wrong were I not, regardless
of any insults to myself, to step forward and
attempt to expose the fallacy of the course pursued
by the meeting, especially, as the Shipowners had
grievances which really ought to be redressed, and to
which the Legislature, I felt sure, would readily listen,
if properly appealed to. Shipowners were then, unquestionably,
subjected to various burdens which
would never have been imposed upon them had they
not been a <i>protected class</i>, and, as such, supposed to
derive advantages from which other classes of the
community were excluded; burdens, too, I am bound
and willing to add, from which they ought to have
been relieved when the Navigation Laws were repealed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Lindsay
proposes
an
amendment.</div>

<p>Feeling, therefore, that the time of this large and
important meeting would be wasted in vain and useless
resolutions, I stepped forward to the front of the
platform, resolved, at all hazards, to endure every
contumely, and, if I could not carry an amendment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
which I saw was altogether hopeless, to at least enter
my protest as a British Shipowner against such subservient
and worthless appeals to the Legislature of
our country. My appearance on the front row was
the signal for a yell of derision; and my amendment,
which I had hastily written in pencil, “that a petition
be presented to both Houses of Parliament, praying
for an inquiry into the actual condition of British
navigation, and for relief from all peculiar burdens
and restrictions that still fetter maritime enterprise,”
was received with hisses and the loudest and rudest
demonstrations of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Although these events are matters for history, they
are of too personal a character to be pursued at
length; however, that my readers may form some idea
of the feelings of a very large number of the most
influential Shipowners of the period, I furnish in a
foot-note<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> extracts from the report which appeared in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>the ‘Times’ and of other journals of the proceedings
of this great meeting.

<div class="sidenote">Effect of

and

<p>But, even if the Legislature had been disposed to
consider the wailings of the Shipowners, or to listen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
to their unreasonable demands, an event supervened
which for a time changed the aspect of their affairs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
Critical questions arose in Europe. Political relations
between France and Austria had become most
unsatisfactory. The Emperor of the French, having
recently, by a member of his family, contracted an
alliance with a Princess of the House of Savoy, welded
another political link with the King of Sardinia, and,
on the 1st January, 1860, announced an approaching
rupture with Austria. “A cry of anguish” arose
from the provinces of Lombardy; and all the miseries
the Italians, during many years, had suffered from
Austrian domination were suddenly and ostentatiously
paraded before the world. Free Europe witnessed
with astonishment the scene in which the despotic
Emperor of the French complained of the tyranny
exercised by another despot in Austria, over a portion
of Austrian subjects, whilst the Emperor of
Russia, more despotic than either, joined in the strange
and mysterious confederacy, and affected sympathy
for the down-trodden and oppressed Italians.</p>

<p>It was impossible for Great Britain to remain indifferent
while events so momentous were happening
in rapid succession on the continent of Europe; hence,
when Austria summoned Sardinia to disarm, and the
French troops were put in motion to cross the Alps,
the English people, carried away by their sympathies
for the oppressed Italians, and forgetting to inquire
“Can grapes come from thorns, or figs from thistles?”
were almost willing to join France and aid her in her
real object, the advancement of the eastern portion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
the Empire towards the Rhine. But, whatever the
results of the short but great war then publicly
proclaimed by France and Sardinia against Austria,
its effect, by increasing the demand for shipping,
combined with other causes, proved very salutary to
the fortunes of British Shipowners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Lindsay
moves
for an inquiry
into
the burdens
on the
Shipping
Interest,
January
31, 1860.</div>

<p>Though England had been startled by the proceedings
on the Continent, and had made preparations
for any emergency, she happily kept clear of
“entanglement,” so that Parliament had time to
direct its attention to other less exciting, but to her
more important subjects. Under these circumstances,
I consequently, on the 31st January, 1860, renewed
my motion,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> for an inquiry into the state of our merchant
shipping, and the operations of the burdens
and restrictions especially affecting that interest.
After a long and interesting discussion, the House
was pleased to adopt my motion, extending the inquiry
into various Acts of Parliament then in force;<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
and, on the 16th February of that year, the Committee
was appointed:<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> the whole of that session was
devoted to the inquiry, and to the complaints and
suggestions of the Shipowners and other persons
interested, who were heard in detail: no less than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>6813 questions were asked, and as many answers
given in reply, and voluminous appendices swelled
the Report.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Report of
the Committee
thereon.</div>

<p>No Committee ever commenced its duty with a
more fixed determination to grant impartial justice
and remedy any existing evils. I shall not venture
to offer an opinion on the Report, as it was drawn
up by myself, at the request of my colleagues. But
I ought to state that the Committee examined most
carefully and anxiously, in all its bearings, the great
question with which it had to deal, and enabled
me to prepare a report which was strictly just and
thoroughly exhaustive, and which I hope has rendered
unnecessary any further appeals, at least, on
similar grounds, for relief to the Legislature. In
prosecution of their inquiries the Committee examined
numerous persons residing in London and the outports
connected with the shipping interests, many of whom
were extensively engaged in the home, colonial, and
foreign trades. They also examined several officers
in various departments of her Majesty’s Government,
and others representing two of the corporations,
which exercise trading powers affecting shipping,
so as to more fully elucidate the subjects with
which they were respectively acquainted. They
then reviewed in detail the various measures which
had been introduced during the previous quarter of
a century affecting maritime commerce, directing attention
to that part of the evidence which stated that
the reason, why the Coasting trade was not thrown
open until 1854, was the assertion on the part of the

<div class="sidenote">The
Netherlands.</div>

<p>Referring to existing treaties, the Committee remarked
that, though the Government of the Netherlands
placed the ships of England, ostensibly, on the
same footing as Dutch vessels, English vessels, however,
in consequence of the regulations of the Dutch
East India Company, were practically prevented from
trading with the valuable settlements of the Dutch
in the Eastern seas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
United
States.</div>

<p>When directing attention to the different nations
who still withheld from British ships the advantages
of their coasting trade, they could not fail to notice
the often repeated fact, that the United States of
North America not only shut out British vessels
from the carrying of goods in the vast coasting trade
of their Atlantic and Pacific sea-boards, but that
British vessels running between New York and
Aspinwall, and between Panama and San Francisco,
were denied the ordinary privileges enjoyed by the
American national flag; and that, thus, the indirect
carrying trade between the eastern and western coast
of the United States was, practically, confined to
American shipping, as well as the coasting trade
proper.</p>

<p>With regard to British colonial possessions the
Committee stated that, while the coasting trade had
been thrown open to foreign vessels in the British
East Indies, Ceylon, the Cape of Good Hope, and
Victoria, the coasting trade of our North American
colonies was still confined to British vessels; foreign
ships being, however, permitted to carry on the
inter-colonial trade with our various possessions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Generally
unsatisfactory</div>

<div class="sidenote">state of
the intercourse
with
foreign
nations.</div>

<p>The Committee, especially, noticed the entire
unanimity of the witnesses whom they had examined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
with regard to the unsatisfactory state of the laws
then regulating international intercourse, not merely
with the United States of America, but also with
France, Spain, and Portugal; nor could they fail to
perceive that every witness viewed with the greatest
jealousy the restrictions still imposed by those nations
on our shipping, and further, that we had not been
met by them in that spirit of fairness and reciprocity
we had a right to expect.</p>

<p>So far as regards the great question—the repeal
of the Navigation Laws—into which the Committee
inquired minutely and impartially, I may say that
they were, unanimously, of opinion that it would be
impossible to reverse the established policy of Free-trade,
and that, in fact, it would not be to the interests
of our Shipowners, if they had been able to do
so. Indeed, the representatives of the then most
conservative ports in the kingdom (Mr. Horsfall for
Liverpool, and Mr. Liddell, now Lord Eslington,
one of the members for Northumberland) were decidedly
of opinion that any reversal of our policy
would not merely be prejudicial to the great trading
interests of this country, but, specially so, to those
engaged in its maritime commerce; and, in fact,
though they felt the advantages derivable by reciprocal
advantages from foreign nations, they were
not prepared to support an Order in Council against
the admission to our ports of the ships of those
nations which did not reciprocate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The present
depression
beyond the
influence
of Government.</div>

<p>While admitting the depressed state of the shipping
interest during the previous two or three
years, the Committee pointed out that this depression
had arisen in great measure from causes beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
reach or province of legislation. They remarked, for
instance, with great force, that as one-fourth part of
the whole coasting trade was then carried on by means
of steam-vessels, while one steamer could accomplish
as much work as five sailing vessels, it must follow
that the owners of the latter would suffer; the result
clearly showing that the depression arose in the
north of England ports to a great extent from causes
no government could control. Instancing Sunderland,
they remarked that while in 1852 there were
no steamers whatever engaged in trade at that
port, the number of such vessels built there since
that period (between 1852 and 1860) had displaced
the enormous number of 4000 sailing ships, each
of 250 tons capacity. Hence, while the Committee
could not but regret the heavy loss thus entailed on
one industrious class of men, many of whom were, no
doubt, totally ruined, it was impossible for them to
remedy a state of things brought about mainly by
the progress of science, and one, moreover, with
which the change in our policy had nothing whatever
to do. Indeed, not one of the witnesses
examined, although many of them had been sufferers
in this way, proposed to recur to the absolutely
restrictive system in vogue previously to 1850.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
results of
Steamers
<i>versus</i>
Sailing
vessels.</div>

<p>When the figures brought forward by the opponents
of repeal were closely examined, it appeared
that, while the increase of all the sailing ships in the
United Kingdom had for nine years previously to
the change in our Navigation Laws been only 23½
per cent., the increase of steamers, during the same
period, had been as much as 81 per cent.; but that
since then to the end of 1859, while the increase of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
sailing ships had been 26½ per cent., steamers had
increased no less than 184 per cent. These were
transient evils against which no legislation could provide;
and it was, therefore, obvious that, instead of
attempting to render remunerative a class of vessels,
now obsolete owing to the improvements of the age,
Shipowners would have done better to direct their
attention to the development of the new power, for
which they possessed in vast abundance the requisite
materials of iron and coal: in this way, there could
be no doubt that they would be able to compete successfully
with all other nations. In how remarkable
a manner these words have been fulfilled I shall be
able to show when I come to treat of the progress
of steam navigation in the Transatlantic trades.
Nor has our success been less remarkable in our
competition with the Swedes and Norwegians, with
whom it was repeatedly alleged we were unable to
compete; for they, in 1859, had already become
large buyers of ships in our markets, and, I may add,
are still frequently to be found purchasers of British-built
vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Committee
resists the
plan of
re-imposing
restrictions
on
the
Colonial
Trade.</div>

<p>The question having now been narrowed to that
of re-imposing the monopoly of the carrying trade
to and from our Colonial possessions, the Committee
soon arrived at the conclusion that the extent,
diversified interests, and increasing power of our
possessions abroad, offered insuperable obstacles to
the re-imposition of restrictions on that trade, while
the daily increase of feelings of independence in our
Colonies naturally tended to resist a system which
would place the grower of British plantation sugar
and coffee in the West Indies at a greater disadvantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
than then existed, especially when compared
with the producer of slave-grown sugar and coffee in
Brazil and Cuba. The Committee, therefore, looking
to our relations with Canada, our possessions in
the East and West Indies, and, above all, in Australia,
considered it their duty, unhesitatingly, to declare
that any proposal having for its object the re-establishing
an exclusive monopoly of the carrying
trade to and from our colonial possessions must, both
on political and commercial grounds, be rejected as
altogether impracticable. Moreover, that, while such a
step would be unjust to our fellow-subjects in the colonies,
it would very likely embroil us with those foreign
Powers to whom we were bound by existing treaties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty
of <i>enforcing</i>
reciprocity.</div>

<p>The question, however, of the expediency of requiring
foreign Powers, having colonial possessions,
to reciprocate every advantage to us, which Great
Britain had accorded unconditionally to them, though,
commercially, when compared with other branches of
commerce, unimportant, was one which demanded
peculiar attention, as it was, and still is, a source
of great annoyance, in that it creates a feeling that we
have been very illiberally, if not unjustly, dealt with
by these Powers. British Shipowners who, carried on
the restricted and scarcely tolerated intercourse with
the colonies of France, Spain, and Portugal, found
their ships placed at an immense disadvantage, in the
unequal competition they had to encounter, while they
had the mortification to see foreign ships resort to our
own colonies and secure much higher freights than
our own ships when chartered to a port in Europe.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span></p>
<p>For instance, it was given in evidence that Spanish
vessels were chartered in English ports to Manilla at
3<i>l.</i> or 4<i>l.</i> per ton, while the British vessel could not
obtain 30<i>s.</i> per ton. From the Mauritius to Europe
a French ship, enjoying the option of both the
British and French markets, obtained a freight for
sugar of 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per ton at a time when English
ships were obliged to accept 10<i>s.</i> per ton. Thus, in
all our colonies and possessions, French, Spanish, and
Portuguese vessels<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> could generally procure a freight
greatly in excess of that obtained by British ships, as
the foreign national flag secured for them, on arrival at
a port of call in England, the advantage of our markets,
with the option of sending on the cargo to the
respective countries of Europe to which the national
flag belonged, but from which markets such produce
was excluded by heavy differential duties, if conveyed
thither in British ships.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Want of
energy on
the part
of the
English
Foreign
Office.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span></p>
<p>The Committee naturally felt that a sense of justice
demanded that our Shipowners should, as far as practicable
and consistent with the interests of the community,
be placed on equal terms in the race of
competition, and that, whatever difficulties might
stand in the way of having recourse to retaliatory
measures, there had been, they regretted to state, an
apparent apathy on the part of the executive government,
in remonstrating with those nations which
then excluded our vessels from their trade; in other
words, that the Foreign Office had not employed the
influence it might have exercised to secure, by diplomatic
negotiation, the advantages of reciprocity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rights of
belligerents.</div>

<p>As the question of belligerent rights at sea was one
which deeply affected alike the British Shipowner in
the prosecution of his business and the general interests
of Great Britain, the Committee devoted their
especial attention to the evidence advanced on this
important question.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Privateering
abolished
in Europe;</div>

<p>In the recent war with Russia, England, as we
have already incidentally noticed, when she formed
an alliance with France, agreed with that country to
waive her right to confiscate an enemy’s goods on
board neutral ships as also neutral goods found on
board an enemy’s, so long as they were not, in either
case, contraband of war. This mutual but provisional
waiver of belligerent rights placed the allies in harmonious
action, and, practically, countenanced the
principle that “free ships make free goods.” Upon
the return of peace, as I have explained in a previous
portion of this work, the declaration of Paris of April,
1856, signed by Austria, France, Great Britain,
Prussia, Russia, Sardinia, and Turkey gave a formal
sanction to this principle. Privateering was also
abolished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">America,
however,
declining
to accept
this proposal.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Views of
the Committee
thereon,</div>

<p>America was invited to be a party to this general
international agreement, but demurred, and coupled
at first her assent to the abolition of privateering,
with the condition that private property at sea should
no longer be subject to capture. Finally, she refused
to be a party to a convention, whereby she would be
precluded from resorting to her merchant marine for
privateering purposes, in case she became a belligerent.
But this, in the opinion of the Committee, was not
surprising, as the United States had obtained the
recognition of the rights of neutrals, for which she
contended throughout a long period of hostilities,
and Great Britain had surrendered those rights without
any equivalent from her. The Committee were
therefore of opinion that our Shipowners would
thereby be placed at an immense disadvantage in
the event of a war breaking out with any important
European Power. Indeed, they went so far as
to give it as their deliberate conviction that “the
whole of our carrying trade in the event of a great
European war would be inevitably transferred to
American and other neutral bottoms.”</p>

<p>“We must therefore,” they continued, “either
secure the general consent of all nations to establish
the immunity of merchant ships and their cargoes
from the depredations of both privateers and armed
national cruisers during hostilities, or we must
revert to the maintenance of our ancient rights,
whereby, relying upon our maritime superiority,
we may not merely hope to guard unmolested our
merchant shipping in the prosecution of their business,
but may capture enemy’s goods in neutral
ships, and thus prevent other nations from seizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
the carrying trade of this kingdom during a state
of hostility.”</p>

<p>Looking at this important question in all its bearings,
and considering that we have at all times a
much larger amount of property afloat than any
other nation, the Committee were of opinion, that,
though grave objections had been urged by high
authorities against any further step in advance, they
could not close their remarks without expressing an
earnest hope, and, at the same time, giving it as a
deliberate opinion, that “in the progress of civilisation,
and in the cause of humanity, the time had
arrived when all private property (not contraband
of war) should be exempt from capture at sea.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">and on the
liability of
Merchant
Shipping.</div>

<p>Having reviewed the question of liability, of which
many Shipowners had complained, the Committee
were of opinion that it was not advisable to reduce
that liability to any extent below the value of the
ship and freight, taking the value of the former at 15<i>l.</i>
per ton. For to confine it simply to the actual value
of the ship “would,” they urged, “be an encouragement
to unprincipled persons to employ inadequate
and worn-out vessels in the conveyance of passengers,
and that, on the other hand, to subject
shipowners to unlimited liability might induce men
of property and character to withdraw their fortunes
from so great a hazard.” The Committee
could not, however, overlook the additional liability
to which Shipowners were exposed by the operation
of the municipal laws of foreign states, for,
as the law now stands, the liability of the foreign shipowner
is not limited to our courts, and the liability
of the English shipowner by the same rule, if it were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
applied in the United States, would not be limited in
their courts.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Therefore, although the English law
may have contemplated the limitation of the British
shipowners’ liability, any damage sustained by collision
on the high seas between a British ship and a
foreign vessel, would not fall within the statutory
limit, and, practically, the liability of the British shipowner,
in the event of loss of life, would be unlimited,
or at least co-extensive with the loss, which a
jury might assess according to the rank of life and the
injuries sustained by the relatives and families of
the deceased. It was further recommended that the
practicability and desirability of an international arrangement
with maritime countries,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> so as to arrive
at some uniform reciprocal principles, should be
seriously considered by Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burden of
light dues.</div>

<p>The incidence of the light dues paid by the Shipowners
of the Empire, necessarily received consideration
from the Committee, more especially as it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>a serious burden on all merchant vessels. So far back
as 1845, a Committee appointed specially to inquire
into those dues, recommended, “That all expenses for
the erection of lighthouses, floating-lights, buoys, and
beacons, on the coast of the United Kingdom, be
henceforth defrayed out of the public revenue.”</p>

<p>Entirely agreeing with this resolution, the Committee
of 1860, while recommending Government to
adopt that resolution, added: “That the lighting of
our shores is a high imperial duty which we owe,
not merely to ourselves, but to strangers, whom we
invite to trade with us.”</p>

<p>They felt that the justice as well as the policy of
such a course was strengthened by the fact that the
large debt of 1,250,000<i>l.</i>, the result of improvident
grants, incurred under the authority of Parliament
for buying up the lighthouses held by private individuals,
had, since that period (1845), been paid out
of light dues, raised out of a tax upon shipping, and
they had less hesitation in recommending the adoption
of this enlightened policy from the fact that the
Congress of the United States of America appropriates
an annual vote for lights throughout their whole
territory, which is borne by the entire federation,
and that no charge for light dues is levied on foreign
vessels frequenting the ports of that country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pilotage.</div>

<p>The question of pilotage was also one which received
every consideration, the evidence showing that
when a voluntary system prevailed, even where the
navigation was difficult and, at times, dangerous, no
inconvenience arose from the absence of legal compulsion
for the employment of a pilot. Many of the
members of the committee were of opinion that the
whole pilotage of the kingdom should be thrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
open; but no decided recommendation was offered,
as it had been pretty clearly demonstrated in evidence
that the compulsory system of pilotage still exercised
at London, Liverpool, and Bristol, had worked in a
manner satisfactory to those persons who were most
directly interested in this matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charges
made by
local
authorities,
now
generally
abolished;</div>

<p>The charges levied by local authorities on ships
and goods entering or clearing from their ports, had
so frequently been under the consideration of Parliament,
that the Committee could do little more than
refer to the various reports on this subject, and especially
to that of the Royal Commissions of 1854,
with the expression of their regret that not one of
the recommendations of that commission had been
carried into effect.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">as well as
those of
the Stade
dues.</div>

<p>The Committee, after inquiring into the management
of the Trinity Houses of Newcastle and Hull,
and the nature of the charges levied by the Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
Company and by the King of Hanover on shipping,
under the name of Stade dues, both of which have
since then been happily abolished, reviewed our mercantile
marine legislation since 1835, and were of
opinion that, though, in many respects the measures
adopted had been judicious and beneficial, a few had
been carried to excess in matters of detail (an opinion
very different to that which at present prevails in the
House of Commons); nor, indeed, could they have
arrived at any other conclusion, as various witnesses
clearly showed that, in some instances, a zealous
wish to accomplish improvements, and to protect the
interests of the public, had led to the adoption of
legislative measures of a too minute and restrictive
character, and, above all, that any unnecessary interference
as to how a ship should be built, fitted,
manned, and navigated, was frequently attended
with prejudicial consequences, while it had as frequently
retarded beneficial advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Report
of 1860
generally
accepted
by the
mercantile
marine.</div>

<p>Such were the leading points of the report of the
Merchant Shipping Committee of 1860. It seems to
have satisfied all parties as far as anything could
satisfy men whose policy had been ignored; at least
no further inquiry into the state of British shipping,
or for relief from oppressive and unjust burdens has
since been considered either expedient or necessary.
Indeed, the great majority of the recommendations
have since been carried out by successive Governments.
The Local Charges Bill, which had been
referred to a Select Committee in 1856, was dealt
with by separate inquiries; the important case of
Liverpool occupying the whole of the Session of
1857, ultimately resulting in a reform of the Dock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
management, and in the transfer of the Liverpool
town dues to the Dock estate.</p>

<p>In 1861, Mr. Milner Gibson, then President of the
Board of Trade, introduced a Bill<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> by which most of the
other grievances were removed. All taxes on shipping,
raised for the purpose of granting pensions and other,
so-called, charitable objects, were abolished; local
differential charges on foreign shipping were, to a
large extent, prohibited;<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> the passing tolls levied for
the support of such harbours as Ramsgate, Dover,
and Bridlington were swept away, and power (on
the recommendation originally of the Harbours of
Refuge Commission of 1854) was given to the Public
Works Loan Commissioners to lend money for the
improvement of trading harbours at a low rate of
interest.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> France, to whose shipping laws I shall
hereafter refer, abolished her local charges and differential
dues; Italy, in 1863, admitted British ships
to national treatment; and Austria also, by treaty,
in 1868, has followed her example.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Shipowners are still taxed for the
maintenance of the National lights; but, although the
recommendations of various Committees have not in
this respect been adopted, reductions in the charges
levied have been made to no less an extent than
75 per cent, since 1853.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Great improvements have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>also been made since Mr. (now Lord) Cardwell put in
motion this scale of reduction, which has proved so
valuable in its results; since then no less than fifty-seven
new lighthouses have been built, and fifteen
new light ships moored on the coast, whilst thirty-seven
old lighthouses have been rebuilt and re-organised
at an aggregate cost of more than one
million pounds sterling.</p>

<p>From 1860 the Shipowners of Great Britain,
though they have experienced in their trade, like
all other branches of trade, periods of depression,
and rarely more so than at the present moment, have
never looked backwards. All special and peculiar
burdens having now been removed, their only present
desire is, and it is not an unreasonable one, that they
should be interfered with as little as possible—certainly
not more so than is necessary for the protection
of the public—in the management of their
own affairs, and that they should have a fair and free
field: they seek no favours.</p>

<p>What they have done since they have had free
scope to their industry and skill, and been relieved
from all unfair taxation on the one hand, and the
swaddling-clothes of protection on the other, <i>is truly
astonishing</i>. Since then, no country has produced
more magnificent steam and sailing ships, the former
having all but monopolised the great Transatlantic
carrying trade, to which I shall fully refer hereafter,
and the latter having driven the American clippers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
entirely from the China trade.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Such are the effects
of wholesome competition.</p>

<p>On her first voyage from London to Melbourne,
starting in November 1868, the <i>Thermopylæ</i> made
the quickest passage on record between those ports—viz.
in sixty days from pilot to pilot. Nor was
this a mere chance passage, for on the next voyage
from London to Melbourne she accomplished the same
distance in sixty-one days, still faster than any other
known passage between these ports; and, so far as
I can ascertain, these voyages have never since been
equalled by any other sailing vessels. On her first
voyage, after leaving Melbourne she took on board a
cargo of coals at Newcastle (New South Wales) for
Shanghai, and accomplished the passage thence in
twenty-eight days—the quickest on record. Leaving
Foo-chow-foo soon afterwards with a cargo of tea,
she made the passage thence to London in ninety-one
days.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> This has never been surpassed, except by

passage to London in ninety days<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> (her owner

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
Indeed, so completely have
we outstripped the United States and all other
nations, that instead of American clippers bringing
teas from China to supply the London market,
English clippers are frequently engaged to load the
early teas from China to New York.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span></p>
<p>Nor have other trades than that of China been
very far behind in this great ocean race. Many of
the sailing vessels now engaged in the trade with
Australia and India are remarkable for their swiftness
and increased capacity, combined with greatly
reduced sailing expenses. Superior in speed to any
of the ships of the old East India Company, they have
double the space for cargo in proportion to their
register tonnage, and are manned and navigated by
about one-third the number of men. Among them and
the China clippers are to be found some of the handsomest
vessels the world has ever seen. Marvellous
specimens of grace and beauty, not surpassed even
by the finest yachts, and much easier in their movements,
when under full sail and at their greatest
speed, than any “thing of beauty” yet produced in
either Great Britain or the United States for the
purposes of ocean navigation.</p>

<p>But however great have been the strides in the
improvement of the merchant vessels of Great Britain,
their rapid increase in number since the repeal of the
Navigation Laws has been equally astonishing; while
the freedom of our laws has given an impetus to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
maritime commerce far beyond the most sanguine
hopes of those who, a quarter of a century ago,
most strenuously advocated the policy of Free-trade.
That my readers may see how we stand, so far
as our ships are concerned, in comparison with other
nations, I have had a table prepared, which will be
found in the Appendix,<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> showing the progress
they have made as compared with other countries,
before and after the repeal of our Navigation
Laws. The figures are remarkable; and, though
it is not the province of this work to enter upon
controversial questions, I cannot refrain from directing
the attention of my readers to the fact that the
nations which have adopted a liberal policy have
made much the greatest advance; while the United
States of America, to which I have so frequently
referred, have, with all their natural advantages,
materially retrograded as a maritime people. Nor
have continental nations, like France, to which
I shall presently refer, made any progress worthy
of note under the ancient commercial policy, to
which they still, in a large measure, and most unwisely,
adhere.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_196" href="#FNanchor_196" class="label">[196]</a> I had served my constituents, I thought, well and faithfully for two
Parliaments. I had fought to obtain reciprocity from foreign nations,
before we repealed our Navigation Laws, the only time when we
could have had any hope of obtaining it unless the statesmen of other
nations became as enlightened as our own; and, having been defeated,
I was then doing my utmost to assist in obtaining for them from our
own Legislature, relief from the unjust and oppressive burdens with
which they had been saddled during a period of protection; consequently,
I could not but feel keenly the determined opposition which
they, the Shipowners—men of my own class—for whom I had worked
so strenuously, had organised against my return to Parliament.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_197" href="#FNanchor_197" class="label">[197]</a> The numbers were, Fenwick, 1527; Lindsay, 1292; Hudson, 790.
The contest was between Mr. Hudson and myself; but, though Mr.
Hudson, better known as the “Railway King” during the fleeting
days of his transitory power, was a strong Conservative, he had done so
much for Sunderland through the railways which he brought into the
town, and the magnificent docks constructed entirely through his
influence, that I felt regret, at having been the instrument of his
political expulsion from the representation of a port, where he had
rendered such marked and valuable services. But I fear it is too
true, that popular constituencies are sometimes as inconsistent as they
are fickle. Henry Fenwick, whom Sunderland on that occasion, and
deservedly so, returned at the head of the poll, and who was one of
the best of members and the manliest of men, soon afterwards lost his
seat, because the Government of the day, appreciating his many good
qualities, had appointed him the Civil Lord of the Admiralty.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_198" href="#FNanchor_198" class="label">[198]</a> When Mr. Dunbar died four or six years afterwards, he left behind
him somewhere close upon one million and a half pounds sterling, the

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_199" href="#FNanchor_199" class="label">[199]</a> “Had I,” continued Mr. Lindsay, “remained a silent spectator at
this meeting as I intended, I should have been an assenting party to a
resolution which asks us to reverse our policy. (‘No, no!’) But such
would have been the case, for the resolution says, ‘that the principal
cause of the depression has been the impolicy of the existing system of
maritime commerce.’ I hold that the establishment of a Free-trade
policy has nothing whatever to do with the existing depression in the
shipping interest (cries of ‘Oh, oh!’ and great disapprobation), and
therefore I come forward and offer my dissent. This resolution, further,
asks us to confirm a memorial which the Shipowners’ Society of London,
this time last year, addressed to her Majesty. I, for one, cannot be a
consenting party to that resolution or memorial, because I believe that
the opinions therein expressed are fallacious, and I shall endeavour to
show you how. What is the prayer of that memorial? It urgently
entreats, indeed implores her Majesty to issue an Order in Council
against those nations which have not reciprocated with us. (‘Bravo!’
and cheers.) I am in favour of reciprocity—it is Free-trade in its
most extended sense—but I ask you to look at the difference between
reciprocity and the <i>enforcement</i> of reciprocity by the Legislature.
Enforced reciprocity, as prayed for by you in this memorial, is Protection
in its worst and most pernicious form. (Cries of ‘Shame,’ and
hisses.) It is a renewal of the old war of tariffs; therefore, it is the
war of Protection. (Great uproar.) We must not retrograde, our
course is onward.” (Hisses and uproar.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">G. F. Young</span>: I rise to order. (Cheers, and a few cries of “No,
no!”) Sir, I will not so far depart from the usages of debate as to
introduce a speech on rising to order, but will submit that the course
of discussion is irregular and unfair. I have challenged the hon.
member to discuss this particular point with me publicly. He has
declined my challenge. (Great cheering.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: I think that my friend Mr. Young in calling my
hon. friend Mr. Lindsay to order has rather himself travelled a little
out of order. (“Hear, hear!” and a laugh.) I cannot think that Mr.
Lindsay is out of order; but it will rest with the meeting to decide
whether or not they will hear Mr. Lindsay in continuation. (“Hear,
hear!” and disapprobation.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lindsay</span>: Gentlemen, remember that we are in the city of
London, and that the eyes of England are upon us. We are assembled
to discuss a question of deep interest to its maritime interests, viz.,
what is the best course for the nation to pursue in the first place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Young</span>: No, no; to inquire what should be done. (“Hear, hear!”)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lindsay</span>: Well, then, I suppose it is to discuss this, that we
have come here. Now, I say, we have to inquire what is the best policy
to be pursued for the nation at large (cheers); and, secondly, for ourselves
as shipowners. (Cheers.) The question before us is this, whether
the reversal of our Free-trade policy will be best for the interest
of the country at large. (“Hear, hear!” hisses and confusion.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">G. F. Young</span>: The Legislature will inquire into that. (“Hear,
hear!”)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lindsay</span>: I say this resolution goes to the root of Free-trade, and
confirms the memorial sent by you last year to the Queen. (Cheers.)
Now, then, in reply to that memorial—and bear in mind that you
received that reply from a Protectionist Government, my Lord Derby’s
through whom you made this appeal. (“Hear,” cheers, hisses, and
cries of “Question, question!”) I am speaking to the question. Now,
the answer given to your memorial by the Board of Trade clearly and
distinctly proved that under a Free-trade policy the British shipping
had increased in a far greater ratio than it ever did under a Protectionist
policy. (“Hear, hear!” and a cry, “Prove it!”) It has been
proved, and let those deny it who can, that from 1842 to 1849 British
shipping built and registered during the period of reciprocity increased
843,000 tons; but from 1850 to 1857 it had increased 1,670,000 tons,
or more than double under Free-trade what it did under Protection.
(Cries of “Bosh!”) It has been proved further, that the entries inwards
and clearances outwards—(confusion, “Hear, hear!” and “No!”) It
does not suit, you to hear the truth—you Protectionist shipowners!
(Confusion.) I say it has been proved that the entries and clearances
of British shipping have increased (cries of “Hear!” “No!”
“Turn him out!”) in a ratio equally as great as the tonnage built and
registered. (The hon. gentleman was here met by a storm of indignant
and discordant cries, among which were heard: “Go to Sunderland!”
“Rubbish!” “Bosh!” “Sit down!”) When order was restored the hon.
member resumed as follows:—Mr. Bramley-Moore has referred to what
he calls the advantages which Spain and France have gained by their
protective system. (Uproar.) It is quite true that in the five years
between 1853 and 1857 inclusive, no less than 600,000 tons of Spanish
shipping entered and cleared our ports; but, on the other hand, it
is equally true that, during the same period, no less than 1,700,000
tons of British shipping entered and cleared from Spanish ports.
(“Hear, hear!”) What does Spain, therefore, gain by her system
of protection? (Confusion, and a voice, “We can see all that in the
‘Times.’”) It is true that 3,900,000 tons of French shipping cleared
for the ports of England during a similar period; but it is no less
true that 10,000,000 tons of British shipping entered and cleared
from the French ports. (“Hear, hear!” and “Question!”) I could go
on with many more facts to prove my case. I can prove to you by
undeniable facts that the British shipping interest, however much it
may be distressed at the present time, has been a gainer by the policy
of Free-trade (shouts of disapprobation), and that it is not for your
interest as Shipowners to reverse that policy. (Uproar.) You, no
doubt, wish to confine your trade to your own possessions (“No, no!”),
but what, I ask, would England be if it were not for the vast magnitude
of her trade with foreign countries? (Cries of “Oh, oh!” “Hear,
hear!” and “No, no!”) On referring to the Customs’ entries and
clearances, it will be found that out of the 5,000,000 tons of British
shipping annually so entered, 2,000,000 came from our own colonies
and dependencies, but that no less than 3,000,000 of British shipping are
entered from foreign countries (“Hear, hear!” and confusion), thus
proving that our trade with foreign countries is much more valuable
to us than the trade with our own possessions (cries of “Question!”);
and thus proving, further, that our trade with foreign countries is of
greater advantage, even to the British Shipowner, than our trade with
our own colonies and dependencies. (“Question, question!”) If instead
of the resolution proposed you adopted such a resolution as I have
sketched out since I have been in the room it would have been better
for your interest. (Uproar, and cries of “Sit down!”) You may not
think it for your interest, but the day will come when you will find it
for your interest. (Disapprobation.) If instead of looking after the
shadow, you would follow and grasp at the substance it would be better
for you. (Uproar.) Have any of you looked at the existing burdens on
British shipping? I have done so; but I will not occupy the time of
the meeting by going into details. (Great cheering.) I must, however,
tell you that these burdens are a serious hindrance to our onward
progress; and I also tell you, and I tell you as a thinking man, that
you are vainly attempting to get what you call reciprocity enforced.
I say vainly, because you will never get it. (“Oh, oh!”) You are
losing a chance, a favourable opportunity of obtaining relief from those
burdens which still unjustly oppress the British shipowners. (A
Voice:—“What is the amount?”) I am asked what is the amount?
The amount of these burdens reaches nearly 1,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling. They
are 2 per cent. upon the amount of the capital invested. Tax any
interest 2 per cent., and what is the consequence? You will drive the
capital employed in that interest elsewhere. (“Hear, hear!”) While
that real grievance exists, you are following a shadow (“Oh, oh!”)
How futile then are your attempts! (Confusion.) You are allowing
the opportunity to pass of obtaining substantial relief while you are
following this delusion of Protection. (Great uproar.) The policy I
have recommended is the policy which is best for the interests of the
British Shipowner, and it is as a British Shipowner that I advocate
it. It is, as the representative of a large maritime constituency, that
I have come forward regardless of your insults to state my opinions
frankly on the subject, and to enter my solemn protest against the
course of policy you vainly attempt to restore. (Great disapprobation.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Duncan Dunbar</span> rose to order. He said that they had not met
there to discuss what had brought the shipping interest to its present
state; for he thought the fact would be universally admitted that the
Shipowners were on the road to ruin. (“Hear, hear!”) The object of
the meeting, therefore, was not to discuss figures and tonnage, but
simply to agree to a petition to the Houses of Parliament, asking them
to appoint committees to hear the evidence of witnesses on the subject.
His friend Mr. Lindsay,—no, he would not call him his friend (cheers
and laughter), but the gentleman who spoke last went beside the mark
in talking about the increase or decrease of tonnage. All must admit
that the Shipowners were on the road to ruin. (“Hear, hear!”) The
very property he had made by his industry and hard labour was
melting away like snow before the sun. (“Hear!”) The man who
called himself a British Shipowner, and moved such an amendment as
the present, was the worst enemy the British Shipowner could have.
(Cheers.)</p>

brought into a state of high perfection in all its details by Mr. (now
Lord) Hammond, there can be no doubt that it is very ineffective in
its dealings with foreign nations on nearly all commercial matters.
Perhaps, this would be remedied if the Diplomatic and Consular Service
were amalgamated, or even if it was permitted for gentlemen in the
Consular to rise to the Diplomatic Service. I was strongly impressed
with this idea when serving as a member on the Consular Committee
of 1856-57; but my colleagues on that Committee were generally of a
different opinion. Unquestionably our diplomatists are gentlemen in
every sense of that word, and, as a rule, distinguished scholars, but
they lack that description of knowledge which is expected from the
representatives of by far the greatest commercial and maritime nation
in the world. The time is fast approaching when this may prove a
serious obstacle to our further progress. As times now go, we are a
workshop or we are nothing. I respect rank and envy learning; but
these will not feed the rising and increasing generations, who are to
fill our vacant places.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_206" href="#FNanchor_206" class="label">[206]</a> When I visited the United States after Parliament rose that
session (1860), the question of responsibility was one, to which, with
others, I invited the attention of the Shipowners of that country at
various meetings, with their chambers of Commerce and Boards of
Trade, which were frequently held in public. As the whole of these
questions refer directly to merchant shipping and seamen, I have
given in the <a href="#Appendix2">Appendix</a> of this work, No. 2, p. 567, a copy of a letter I
addressed to Lord Lyons on my arrival in Boston (U.S.), which
embraces the whole of them, as also a subsequent correspondence
which I had in 1866 with our Foreign Office (see <a href="#Appendix3">Appendix No. 3</a>,
p. 571), on the subject of the then unsatisfactory state of our relations
with America, with regard to the responsibility of British Shipowners
when sued in their State Courts. I have the less hesitation in giving
this correspondence as it has not hitherto been published, and as some
of the questions in my letter to Lord Lyons still wait solution.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_207" href="#FNanchor_207" class="label">[207]</a> Since 1860 all passing tolls have been abolished, while most of the
local charges have either been modified or swept away, but not,
however, without a hard struggle, or without the payment of a large
grant of public money to compensate the persons, corporations, or
companies who held “vested interests”—a grant much greater, I
think, than they were entitled to receive.</p>

<p>I remember when Mr. Lowe, in his capacity as Vice-President of the
Board of Trade first brought in this measure, in the Session of 1856,
he exclaimed, in reply to demands of an exorbitant character which
were made on the ground of certain clauses in some very ancient
deeds, <i>What care I for your musty charters!</i> or words to that effect.
You could almost see the hair raising the hats from the heads of a
number of old members who held all their property under musty
charters. But though Mr. Lowe was not very far wrong so far as
regards some of the monstrous claims made under ancient charters,
and would I daresay, if he had had his own way, not have paid the
claimants one-half the amounts they received, the expression was so
appalling as coming from a member of Government, that Lord
Palmerston at once saw that, after what Mr. Lowe had said, it would be
impossible then to pass the Bill, and with his usual tact referred it to
a Select Committee, to which I shall presently refer.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_216" href="#FNanchor_216" class="label">[216]</a> The <i>Sir Lancelot</i> is also a composite vessel. She was built by Mr.
Steele, of Greenock, for her owner, Mr. James MacCunn, of that place,
and was commanded by Captain Richard Robinson, a native of Maryport,
who was brought up in the service of Messrs. Broklebanks, of Liverpool,
and who had, previously to being placed in command of the <i>Sir Lancelot</i>,
made very fast passages in the <i>Fiery Cross</i>. She is 886 tons register;
and her dimensions are—length, 197 feet 6 inches; breadth, 33 feet
7 inches, and depth, 21 feet. This celebrated sailing ship, in her racing
days, spread, when under full sail, 45,500 square or superficial feet of
canvas. She was manned by 30 hands all told, and delivered 1430
tons of tea (of 50 cubic feet to the ton), and her draught of water, when
thus laden, was 18 feet 7 inches forward, and 18 feet 9 inches aft. In
addition to about 200 tons shingle ballast, there was 100 tons of iron
kentledge (specially cast for the purpose), stowed in the limbers—that
is, between the ceiling and the outer skin. This was fitted to the vacant
spaces and distributed along the keelson, tapering towards the foremast
and mizen-mast. It gave the ship great stability, and compensated
for the immense height of the masts, which, without the kentledge,
would have made the ship too tender. In the opinion of her owner, it
contributed greatly to the ship’s success. I may add that the bottom,
which consists of teak, was carefully planed before the metal was put
on, and was quite as smooth as the bottom of a yacht.</p>

<p>As everything relating to this famous sailing ship must prove interesting
and instructive to my nautical readers, I do not hesitate to
furnish the following details of her performances, courteously supplied
to me (4th October, 1875) by Mr. MacCunn. “The log,” he says, “of
the <i>Sir Lancelot</i>, I regret, is not by me, but I have pleasure in handing
you exact leading particulars of the celebrated passage referred to
(extracted by me at the time, with great minuteness, from the log on
board the ship, 14th October 1869).</p>

<p>“The greatest day’s work of the <i>Sir Lancelot</i> was crossing from Anjer
to the Cape, when she made, by observation, 354 miles in 24 hours.
For 7 days (consecutive) she averaged on the same track, with a beam
wind, slightly over 300 miles per day; but I think the most remarkable
feature in the sailing of this ship was the maintenance of a comparative
high speed in light winds, and the great power she had to beat dead to
windward against a strong breeze.</p>

<p>“I may mention that after the racing premium was abolished, and
with it the sort of mania for China clipper sailing, I had 8 feet cut
off all the lower masts, and reduced the masts aloft and the yards in
proportion.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding this the <i>Sir Lancelot</i> is now arrived in London
after a voyage from London to Shanghai with general cargo, thence to
New York with a tea cargo, thence to London with a general cargo—all
in 9 months and 2 days.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I am troubling you with too many details, but I feel
proud that this celebrated clipper, one of the very few China clippers
left, proves herself in the tenth year of her life as swift as ever.”</p>

<p>Mr. MacCunn may well be proud of his ship, and such pride is one
of the chief causes of our power and greatness as a maritime nation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_217" href="#FNanchor_217" class="label">[217]</a> Among those who took the lead in the production and improvement
of clipper ships at that time may be mentioned Captain Maxton,
of the <i>Titania</i>, who had formerly commanded the early iron clippers,
<i>Lord of the Isles</i> and <i>Falcon</i>, and who has, with the assistance of Messrs.
Robert Steele and Son, brought out in successive years the <i>Ariel</i> and
<i>Titania</i>, vessels of great beauty. Nor must I overlook Captain Bullock,
who navigated the <i>Challenger</i> through the most successful and exciting
part of her career; and Captain Rodger, who commanded the <i>Kate
Carnie</i>, and subsequently owned the <i>Taeping</i>, <i>Ellen Rodger</i>, <i>Min</i>, and
other well-known clippers. Among the builders, the name of the late
Mr. William Pile, of Sunderland, should not be overlooked: he designed,
built, and launched many famous clipper ships, such as the <i>Spray of the
Ocean</i> and the <i>Crest of the Wave</i>, two of the handsomest sailing vessels
that ever floated. The latter vessel once left Shanghai for London
with the American clipper ship, <i>Sea Serpent</i>, a well-known China
trader, which was to receive 30s. per ton extra freight on her cargo of
young teas (which obtain the highest price in their relative qualities),
if she beat the <i>Crest of the Wave</i>. Both ships arrived off the Isle of
Wight the same day, but the captain of the American, leaving his vessel
in charge of the pilot, started by railway for London, and reported the
<i>Sea Serpent</i> at the Custom House before his own ship or the <i>Crest of the
Wave</i> had passed through the Downs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First
Navigation
Law
in France,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1560.</div>

<p>The first appearance of anything in the shape of a
Navigation Law which can be traced in the history
of the French nation is to be found about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1560,
during the reign of Charles IX., or rather during
that of his mother, Catherine of Medicis, when Regent.
It is of the most absurdly stringent character, forbidding
French subjects, under any circumstances, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
freight foreign vessels in the ports of his realm. Nor
would he allow such vessels to carry from his ports
any kind of merchandise: but, like most other laws
of a similarly rigorous character, they were very
imperfectly carried out, and so seldom enforced that,
by degrees, they fell into desuetude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Law of
Louis
XIV.,
1643,
revised by
Colbert,
1661.</div>

<p>It was not, however, until the reign of Louis XIV.
(<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1643) that anything like a regular system of
Navigation Laws was adopted; and this would seem
to have been copied from the laws of England of that
period, inasmuch as it had for its object that which
England had proposed with regard to her own ships—the
protection and the development of the French
mercantile marine. But Colbert, the celebrated
finance minister, in 1661, appears to have devoted
considerable attention to this question, and, though
he framed a law, at first as protective in its character
as any of the maritime laws promulgated in England,
it was, soon afterwards, moderately relaxed by his
wisdom, in favour of the ships of other nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its chief
conditions,</div>

<p>In the reign of Louis XIV., as also in that of
Louis XV., various ordinances and regulations were
likewise issued for the purpose of determining the conditions
necessary to entitle a vessel to the privileges
of a French ship. Thus in the regulation bearing
date 24th October, 1681, and, in several letters
as well as in various ordinances, it was provided
that no vessel should be allowed the privilege of
hoisting the French flag, unless she were entirely
owned by the subjects of that country, and unless the
names of all the owners were duly registered. For
every offence, or any deviation from this law, a fine
of 1000 livres was inflicted; and, in case of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
repetition of the offence, corporal punishments were
ordained against all captains who navigated, under
the French flag, any vessel of alien ownership. There
was, however, no prohibition against the acquisition
of vessels of foreign build. French subjects were
allowed to confer on such vessels the French character
by certain declarations, such as dimensions,
where and by whom constructed, and by registering
the names of the owners, and the contract of sale.
No alien was, however, permitted to command a
French vessel; nor, by the ordinance of 27th October,
1727, could even a French subject do so <i>who
had married an alien</i>.</p>

<p>Foreigners were also excluded from any functions
of authority; and, as in the case of the English Navigation
Laws, it was ordained that every vessel should
be manned by a crew of which two-thirds, at least, were
French subjects. Indeed, in 1710, French subjects
were forbidden, agreeably with their most ancient
Navigation Law, to import goods from England in
any but French bottoms—a law, at that time, levelled
exclusively against this country, as it did not
embrace other nations. This law was, however,
abolished, three years afterwards, by the treaty of
Utrecht, though again enforced when war, subsequently,
broke out between the two countries.
Besides this, the duty known by the name of “Droit
de tonnage” (tonnage dues), for the protection of
the French mercantile marine, was levied on all
foreign vessels; and, though England obtained a
temporary exemption from it also by the treaty of
Utrecht, this duty remained practically in force till
replaced by another tonnage duty in 1793. Indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
for a long time, absolute prohibition had existed
against all foreign vessels engaging in the carrying
trade between the ports of France, except those of
Spain, which in 1768 (January 2nd), by a treaty,
known by the name of “Pacte de famille,” signed
by the Kings of France, Spain, the Two Sicilies,
and the Duke of Parma, as members of the reigning
Bourbon family, made the Spaniards free of the existing
French trade, and placed them in all respects
on a similar footing, so far as that treaty was concerned,
with the subjects of France. This privilege,
though suspended by the Revolution, was restored
by the Convention of 20th July, 1814, and still
remains in force, on the part of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Regulations
for
the French
Colonial
trade.</div>

<p>The most important element, however, of the
ancient Navigation Laws of France was the system
of regulations for the purpose of increasing the trade
with the French colonies. In its main features, it
has been preserved by all the Governments, Revolutionary
and Constitutional, which have, successively,
presided over the destinies of that country, continuing
almost unaltered far into the present century,
when it was materially modified, though not entirely
abolished, by the economical reforms of Napoleon III.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Slightly
modified
by the
Treaties of
Utrecht,
1713, and
of 1763, in
favour of
England.</div>

<p>That system, known among French economists and
lawyers under the name of the “<i>Pacte colonial</i>,”
from the implied contract supposed to have been
entered into between each colony on its foundation
and the mother-country was, so far as the rights of
the latter were concerned, characterised by three
principles, which dictated, as far as expediency allowed,
all the laws and measures of the various
Governments previously to the Second Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span></p>

<p>These may be briefly stated as follows:—First,
no goods, the growth, produce, or manufacture of
the colonies, were to be carried to any but a
French market. Secondly, the colonial market was
to be reserved for the commodities and produce of
the mother-country. Thirdly, the carrying of all
goods between the colonies and the mother-country
was to be reserved for the shipping of France.</p>

<p>These rules, which embodied the spirit and policy
of France with regard to her maritime dealings with
her colonies, though undergoing from time to time
various modifications necessitated by circumstances,
have, as far as possible, been upheld and enforced,
and in many cases with considerable severity. Thus,
while the exclusion of alien shippers was jealously
secured by the most stringent measures, as, for
instance, by the law of 1727, Article 3, in which it
was further ordained that no foreigners should land
with their ships or other vessels in the ports, bays,
or harbours, of the French colonies and islands, nor
navigate within one league round the said colonies
and islands, under penalty of confiscation of their
vessels and cargoes, and a fine of 4000 livres, jointly
and severally, upon the master and his crew. These
rigorous prohibitions concerning sailing near the
coast were, however, relaxed in favour of England,
after the cession to this country by France in 1763
under the Treaty of Paris of various islands on the
American coast, but with reference only to such as
were in the vicinity of British possessions.</p>

<p>But these stringent laws, ere long proved most
disadvantageous to France herself, and became a
very great hardship to some of her colonies; for,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
having lost Canada and Louisiana, which carried on
a flourishing trade with the Antilles, the inhabitants
of these islands were deprived of many essential commodities.
Some of their ports were, consequently,
opened to foreign shipping for the importation of
certain enumerated articles, and the exportation of
such of the goods produced by them as could not find
a sufficient market within the French dominions.</p>

<p>Such, in a few words, were the ancient Navigation
Laws of France; nor did the Revolution, which
cast aside so many of the most venerated laws and
customs of that country, discard the system of protection
which those ancient laws were assumed to
afford to their shipping. This system, on the contrary,
seems to have suited the views of the chiefs
of the revolutionary period, and, being, also, in
accordance with the spirit of the stern legislators of
that period, was rendered by them still more stringent
by the addition of special prohibitions, which
their predecessors had not considered expedient.</p>

<p>For instance, a decree of the 13th May, 1791, prohibited
the acquisition from that date of all vessels
of foreign build; and on the 21st September, 1793,
another decree was issued, of a more comprehensive
character.</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that France was then
at war with all the Powers of Europe as well as with
her own Rulers (the King having been beheaded 21st
January, 1793), and, consequently, her commercial
and naval laws were in accordance with the spirit
of war, which has been ever opposed to the progress
and well-being of the people. The laws,
therefore, relating to trade and navigation, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
1792 to 1814 must not be considered such as the
nation would have approved of if at peace, but rather
as warlike measures, presumed to be necessary for
the welfare, and, indeed, for the very existence of
the nation. England being the nearest and most
powerful enemy of France, as well as the financial
supporter of all the other nations then leagued
against her, it is not surprising that French statesmen
should have passed such laws as had special
reference to the injury of her maritime commerce and
her power at sea; and that those laws should have
been thought to display a spirit of revenge and
hatred, though in reality they were merely counterparts
of our own.</p>

<p>Consequently, Article 3 of the law of the 21st
September, 1793, enacted that “No foreign commodities,
productions, or merchandise, shall be imported
into France, or into the possessions or
colonies of France, except directly in French vessels,
or in vessels belonging to the inhabitants of the
countries in which the articles imported grew, were
produced or manufactured, or from the ordinary
ports of sale or exportation.” All officers and three-fourths
of the crew were required to be natives
of the country of which the foreign vessel bore the
flag, under penalty of the confiscation of the ship and
cargo, and a fine of 300 livres, enforceable under
pain of imprisonment, jointly and severally, against
owners, consignees, and agents of the vessel and cargo,
as well as against the captain and mate. Article 4,
copied from the most ancient laws of France, ordained
that foreign vessels should not carry from one
French port to another any commodities, productions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
or merchandise, of the growth, production, or
manufacture of France, or of its colonies or possessions,
under penalties similar to those provided under
Article 3. Another article stipulated that no vessel
should be allowed the privileges of the French flag,
unless built in that country, or in the colonies, or
other possessions of France, or condemned as a prize,
or for any infringement of the laws of the State, and,
unless all the officers and three-fourths of the crew
were French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amount of
charges
enforced.</div>

<p>The provisions of this Act were made more complete
by those of the decree of the 18th of October
of the same year (27 Vindémaire, year II. of the
Republic), establishing, among others, various rules
concerning the amount of repair to be done to a
foreign vessel, sold after wreck in the waters of
France, to entitle her to carry the French flag; the
amount of repair which a French vessel might
undergo in a foreign country without forfeiting its
national character; and the conditions under which
a French subject, resident abroad, might own a
French vessel; together with several enactments for
securing the French character of ships, and for the
proper measurement of their tonnage. At the same
time, there was created by the Act a system of taxes,
for the purpose partly of revenue, and partly of protection,
intended to supersede the previous system of
marine taxation, abolished expressly by Article 29.
Of these new taxes, some applied to the vessel and
some to the cargo; but the most important of them
was a duty, assessed according to tonnage, though
in very different proportions, on all vessels, whether
French or foreign, entering French ports; excepting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
French fishing vessels, or privateers, and French
vessels returning from foreign countries. It amounted
to <i>three</i> sous<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> per ton on French vessels of above
thirty tons engaged in the coasting trade of the
same French sea-board; to <i>four</i> sous per ton, where
the trading was from the French ports of one sea
to those of another; and to <i>six</i> sous, where the navigation
was between France and her colonies or possessions
beyond the limits of Europe. On foreign
vessels, whencesoever they came, an uniform duty of
fifty sous per ton was levied when they discharged
their cargoes in French ports.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French
and
English
Navigation
Laws
equally
worthless.</div>

<p>Such were the most important provisions of these
two stringent laws; they were, however, only similar,
in nearly all respects, to those of England, so
much so that they have, frequently, been called in
France <i>Les Actes de Navigation</i>. Indeed, they were
almost as famous, at the time, in that country as the
so-called celebrated Acts of Cromwell were in Great
Britain—notorious, rather than famous, not for any
benefits they conferred on the people of either
country, but because the object of each was to cripple
the maritime and naval resources of the rival power
without enhancing its own; for, in those days, the
happiness and prosperity of one nation was supposed
to be best promoted by increasing its power of summarily
inflicting punishment for any wrongs attributed
to its neighbour.</p>

<p>But the absolute rule introduced by the law of
the 21st of September, 1793, against the importation
into France of foreign produce by foreign vessels
except those of the country from which the produce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>originally came, could, in the nature of things, be
only partially enforced. Supremacy cannot be obtained
merely by the will of a legislator, nor can a
stroke of the pen conjure navies into existence.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>The mercantile marine of France, which had
almost entirely disappeared during the wars of the
Republic and Empire, progressed so slowly for some
time after the Restoration, that the assistance of
foreign vessels became absolutely necessary for the
supply of the French market. Strange, however, to
say, for the supposed encouragement of the national
shipping, and, as the next best protection that could
be given to it, the carrying marine of all other
nations was heavily weighted, by means of duties
levied on almost all the commodities imported in
foreign bottoms. In the first tariff, published after
the return of the Bourbons, on the 17th of December,
1814, with the object of providing for pressing requirements
until a more matured system could be
established, differential duties were imposed on certain
goods, more or less heavy, according as they were
imported under a foreign or under the French flag.
The system was developed and perfected by the
Finance Law of the 28th of April, 1816, which
established a new order of things, brought about by
the heavy expenses of the <i>centjours</i>, and of the fine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>imposed on the French nation by the treaties of
November, 1815. Consequently, most of such articles
as were admitted free under the French flag, were
charged with duty under a foreign one. For goods
liable to duty, when imported in French bottoms,
the foreign carrying trade was generally mulcted
with an additional charge through the instrumentality
of a series of differential duties called, respectively,
<i>surtaxes de pavillon</i> and <i>surtaxes d’entrepôt</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>Surtaxes
de Pavillon</i>,”
and
“<i>d’Entrepôt</i>.”</div>

<p>The <i>surtaxe de pavillon</i> was the additional duty
levied on such commodities when arriving under a
foreign flag. The <i>surtaxe d’entrepôt</i> was an increase
in the rate of duty on the same merchandise, though
imported under the French flag, coming from the
warehouses of intermediate countries. An example
of both these taxes with reference to coffee may be
drawn from the tariff of the Finance Law, Article
3, of the 28th of April, 1816;<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and, by a further
decree of the 26th June, 1841, it was laid down, as
a general rule, that all goods under a foreign flag
should pay the highest rate of duties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>Droits de
Tonnage.</i>”</div>

<p>But, although this system of differential duties
levied on goods conveyed from their place of production
in foreign vessels, was somewhat modified by
subsequent decrees and treaties of reciprocity, it remained,
practically, in force, or to a considerable
extent, up to a very recent period, while the <i>droits
de tonnage</i> levied on foreign ships alone, were not
abolished until 1867: these tonnage duties were of
the most objectionable and purely protective character,
all French vessels being exempted from this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>charge. Happily, however, for France, there was
one port where they were not exacted, and hence
this has ever been one of her most flourishing commercial
<i>entrepôts</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Special
exemption
of Marseilles.</div>

<p>By a strange anomaly, Marseilles had been, by the
law of the 16th December, 1814, as well as by the
ordinance of the 19th September, 1777, put out of
the pale of the tonnage duty, and made substantially
a free port. This exception, the revival of a
still older privilege, had been conceded for the purpose
of drawing again to Marseilles, as far as possible,
the trade of the Mediterranean, which, during the
long period of warfare through which France had
passed, had been taken possession of by her rivals
in that sea, principally, by the Genoese. The Marseillais
considered it as a very great advantage;
and Cette, besides other ports of the Mediterranean,
solicited a like exemption from a duty they justly
regarded much more as an evil than a protection;
but in vain, till the time when, as will be explained
hereafter, the whole of France was admitted to
the freedom which had so long been the exclusive
privilege of a single port.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French
Colonial
system
preserved
under all
its Governments,</div>

<p>The policy of France with regard to her colonies
under the first Republic was continued by subsequent
Governments, subject, however, to many qualifications
and exceptions, by which the system lost
much of its uniformity and regularity. But with
reference to the treatment of the foreign mercantile
marine, the rule excluding alien vessels from the
trade between France and the generality of her
colonies and possessions was for the most part maintained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span></p>

<p>The term <i>Colonie</i>, or <i>Colonie à Culture</i>, is equivalent
to the English word Plantation. <i>Possession</i> or
<i>établissement</i> applies to such settlements as were
made more especially for the purpose of trading,
some of the other colonies and settlements being of a
mixed character. In the process of time the name of
Colonies, in the vocabulary of the Fiscal and Navigation
Laws, came to be applied in a stricter sense to
the three coffee and sugar islands which had remained
to France, La Guadaloupe, la Martinique,
and Bourbon (or la Réunion as it is now styled).
These three colonies had always been more jealously
guarded than the rest from foreign intrusion, and
had remained very much under the same system; a
series of special regulations common to each of them,
placing them, as it were, apart from the rest. The
rule as to foreign vessels was still exclusion, and
prohibition against approaching the coast (with an
exception in favour of the English flag by the second
Treaty of Paris in 1763 as already stated) was still,
in principle, maintained under the same penalty of
confiscation, a penalty, however, not unfrequently
disregarded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">but greatly
to the injury
of

<p>These restrictive laws, as has been the case with
all other countries, while most injurious to the mass
of the people of France, are really of no benefit to
the Shipowners of that country, in whose favour they
had been passed and so long adhered to. A few
individuals may now and again have been gainers,
to the loss of the community at large, but a reference
to the customs returns of that country too
clearly demonstrates, that its shipping did not keep
pace with the other branches of its commerce, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>
that, ever since the time of Charles IX., when the
Navigation Laws were first imposed, France has had
to depend, frequently, to its serious loss, on the ships
of foreign nations for supplying its population with,
not merely the luxuries, but the actual necessaries of
life: the restrictive system, therefore, though remaining
so long in force and apparent vigour, has ever
exhibited a gradual tendency to decline, and, by slow
degrees, has been worn away by the current of events
flowing towards Free-trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English
Exhibition

<p>It was not, however, until the year 1851 that the
eyes of the people of France really began to be
opened to the advantages to be derived from a policy
of commercial freedom. In that year, the people
of Great Britain had reared in one of the beautiful
parks, by which their capital is adorned, an elegant
structure. The idea, originating with the Society of
Arts, was readily adopted by the Prince Consort
of our beloved Queen.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Perhaps no grander and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>nobler idea ever emanated from the mind of man.
It had for its object peace and good will among
nations, and no structure, hitherto erected, ever
conveyed a more striking impression of “the abodes
of Peace” than did the Crystal Palace of 1851. To
it, all nations were invited to send specimens of the
natural and cultivated produce of their soil, and
the manufactures and arts of their people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Messrs.
Cobden
and
Chevalier
meet first
there,</div>

<div class="sidenote">and, ultimately
in
1860, carry
the Commercial
Treaty.</div>

<p>In that marvellous structure, two great and good
men for the first time met—Richard Cobden of
England and Michael Chevalier of France. Men of
such great intelligence could not fail to see how
numerous were the articles exhibited which were
required by the people of both countries where they
could not be economically produced, but which were
heavily taxed, merely for the special benefit of the
few who produced them, to the great loss of whole
communities; and that, consequently, productions
and manufactures were limited by a system of protection,
alike iniquitous and unnecessary for the
purposes of revenue. They, therefore, resolved to
do what they could to modify the tariffs of both
countries, especially France, and thus to secure a
more free interchange of those articles each country
produced more cheaply and more abundantly than
the other. The result of their labours was the
Commercial Treaty of 1860.</p>

<p>Although, by the great changes in the English tariff,
carried into effect by Sir Robert Peel (1842-46), the
duty on French goods had been much reduced in
England, and on a great number of articles altogether
abolished, France still maintained high duties
on most manufactured articles, and, indeed, prohibited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
altogether the importation of various descriptions
of cotton and woollen cloths; the Treaty of
1860 had, therefore, not only the effect of abolishing
or reducing duties still levied on French goods or
produce imported into England, but of abolishing
prohibitions and reducing duties on British goods
and manufactures imported into France; and, above
all, it gave an impulse to Free-trade ideas throughout
Europe. In fact, immediately after that Treaty
was signed, other treaties were concluded, on liberal
terms, with most of the European States, and their
direct or indirect neighbours. Indeed there was
then a general movement, to a greater or less extent,
in favour of increased freedom of commercial
intercourse between all nations.</p>

<p>Had it been possible, it would perhaps have been
desirable that a Treaty of Navigation should have
accompanied or been embraced in the Treaty of
Commerce with France, but, as it was considered
by Government advisable to keep the one distinct
from the other, a resolution I submitted for the consideration
of the House of Commons,<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> though unanimously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>adopted, was held in abeyance until the
Commercial Treaty had been finally adjusted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
French,
heavy
losers by
maintaining
their
Navigation
Laws.</div>

<p>The discussion on that motion, however, paved
the way for the changes subsequently made in the
ancient Navigation Laws of France. It was shown,
in the most incontrovertible manner, that the people
of that country were serious losers by the maintenance
of these laws, and that, by being unable to
send their produce and manufactures, on as favourable
terms as other nations, to the markets of the
world, they were competing, at a disadvantage to
themselves, while they were likewise sufferers by not
being able to import the raw materials they required
from abroad at the lowest current rates of freight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
Practically, thirty-five out of thirty-six millions of the
nation (for I presume that not more than one million
of the inhabitants of France depend for their living,
directly or indirectly, upon its shipping) were paying
for the support of the remaining thirty-sixth
million.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decline

shipping.</div>

<p>Nor does this payment, which their Navigation
Laws so long enforced, seem to have been of any
advantage to the favoured class for whom it was
made. The shipping of France did not increase.
On the contrary, it actually decreased during the
whole period when these laws were enforced with
the utmost rigour. While, in the year 1787, France
employed 164,000 tons of native shipping in her
trade with foreign countries, she had, forty-three
years afterwards, only 156,000 tons. In her colonial
trade, which was confined entirely to her own ships,
she employed 114,000 tons of French shipping at
the former period, and only 102,000 tons in the year
1860. But the most complete answer to those persons
who desired still to retain the Navigation Laws was
the remarkable fact that, while the protected branches
of her shipping trade decreased, there was a steady
and not inconsiderable increase in those branches of
it, where her ships had to enter into competition
with the vessels of other nations.</p>

<p>Though the motion which the House of Commons
had adopted was in favour of a Treaty, that mode
of negotiation presented so many objections that,
nine months after it had been passed, when Lord
Russell furnished me with an introduction to Lord
Cowley, it was arranged that we should endeavour
to induce the French Government to consider this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
question as one entirely relating to France, and to
urge that she would inquire for herself, and, having
done so, to pass such measures as would be most
conducive to the interests of her own people, irrespectively
of other nations.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> This was the course
subsequently adopted.</p>

<p>There were many enlightened men in that country,
as I shall hereafter show, who entertained opinions
favourable to the desired change, though the prejudice
in favour of the ancient laws and customs had
become so strong in the minds of the mass of the
people, that it would have been all but impossible
to remove it, except through the powerful influence
of the enlightened monarch <i>then</i> governing France,
who readily saw the advantage the nation would
derive from Free navigation. Consequently, he in
due time appointed a council to inquire into the
whole subject.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span></p>

<p>In the meantime an important step was taken
in Colonial Legislation, which paved the way for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
more important changes. La Martinique, la Guadaloupe,
and la Réunion (or Bourbon), the only three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span>
of her old sugar plantations which France still possessed,
had been long complaining that the benefits
they derived from the <i>Pacte Colonial</i> had entirely
ceased, since the protection which their sugar used to
receive in the French market against foreign sugar,
and against that manufactured in France, had been
withdrawn; and that nothing remained of that system,
except the hardships they had to endure from
the exclusion of the foreign trade and flag, and the
difficulty they had in getting rid of their produce,
which the French shipping was not sufficiently
numerous to export.</p>

<p>In consequence of these and other<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> representations,
a law, passed on the 3rd July, 1861, enacted (Articles
1 and 2) that all the foreign commodities allowed to
be imported into France were to be admitted into
Guadaloupe, Martinique, and Bourbon, under the
same conditions and duties. Article 3 broke down
the barrier which had hitherto shut out foreign shipping
from freedom of access to those islands. It
allowed the importation of foreign goods under every
flag, without distinction, subject, however, to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>payment of special duties, which varied according to
the ports from which the goods were brought, and
those to which they were imported. Thus, goods
carried under any foreign flag from Europe or the
Mediterranean to the Antilles, had to pay a duty, per
ton, of 20 francs; if to the Réunion, of 30 francs:
and when from the ports of the Atlantic coast
(except the Cape and its territory), to the Antilles,
10 francs; and to Réunion, 20 francs. The duties,
however, imposed by this Article, were only applicable
to such foreign commodities, admissible under
the previous laws, as were not liable to a higher
duty. Otherwise, that duty was to continue in force.
Article 6 went further, and allowed French goods to
be carried to the colonies in question, and their goods
to France, in foreign bottoms, subject to a duty of
20 francs per ton of cargo between France and the
Antilles, and of 30 francs per ton between France
and La Réunion.</p>

<p>The seventh Article granted the like freedom for
the exportation of the goods of the colonies, either to
foreign countries or to any other colony, provided
such colony were beyond the limits of the coasting
trade. But the law still excluded the foreign mercantile
marine from entering the Colonial coasting
trade, and it was only applicable to the three colonies
mentioned in the Act. Nor were its provisions
applicable to the other French possessions, nor to its
coasting trade; nevertheless, it was an important step
towards the freedom of maritime commerce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commission
of
Inquiry
appointed,
and law
ultimately
passed
May 1866.</div>

<p>Many difficulties, however, had still to be overcome,
and though the <i>Conseil</i>, after a most minute
inquiry, and the publication of three large volumes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
evidence, reported that great changes were imperatively
required in the laws, their recommendations
did not receive the sanction of the French legislative
chambers until 1866,<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> and then only after many prolonged
discussions.</p>

<p>Among these difficulties may be mentioned the
removal of certain local charges on shipping, which
had long been maintained in our ports, and against
the payment of which the French Government had
frequently protested, though neither the vessels of
France nor of other countries were called upon to
pay more than those of our own, except in some
special cases, such as the case of ships owned by
freemen, and other locally privileged persons, who
were exempt. These charges differed in every port,
and sometimes within the limit of the same harbour.
Some of them were levied by virtue of Acts of
Parliament, but others of a vexatious character,
though trifling in amount, were only claimed by a
prescriptive right, through long use. Those which
were levied by prescription were either in the nature
of petty customs, or of duties charged on vessels for
anchorage, keelage, or with respect to ballast or to fees
levied on goods in the nature of cranage, metage,
cartage, wharfage; and, in too many instances, they
were extorted for the use of cranes which had no
existence, or of wharves which for ages had tumbled
into decay. No doubt, in ancient times, it was
an unquestioned prerogative of the Crown to create
petty customs for local purposes, and, though that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>power has long since ceased to exist, when once
granted to corporations or individuals it became
assignable, like other property. It was, therefore,
no easy task to abolish them without conceding the
exorbitant demands of their owners, as the Board of
Trade found out when the Vice-President, Mr. Lowe,
brought the subject before Parliament.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> But France
insisted on their abolition, and, since then, the great
bulk of them have been removed, by purchase or
otherwise.</p>

<p>By Article 1 of the law of the 19th May, 1866,
all materials raw or manufactured, including marine
engines, intended to form parts of the construction
or equipment of iron or wooden vessels, were admitted
into France duty free. Article 2 abolished
the premium granted by the law of the 6th May,
1841, on all steam-engines manufactured in France
intended for international navigation. Article 3 permitted,
after the expiration of six months from the
promulgation of the law, the admission of foreign-built
and fully equipped vessels to registration on
payment of two francs per ton admeasurement;
while Article 4 abolished all tonnage duties upon
foreign ships, except such as had been or might be
levied for the improvement of certain commercial
harbours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its conditions.</div>

<p>But other changes were more tardily made:
Article 5 providing that, only after “three years
from the promulgation of the present law, the surtaxes
on the flag (<i>surtaxes de pavillon</i>), at present
applicable to productions imported from the countries
where they are produced, otherwise than under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
French flag, shall be abolished;” while Article 6
provided for the ulterior establishment, by imperial
decree, of such compensating duties as might be rendered
desirable, in consequence of any other nation
imposing on the French flag higher duties than were
to be levied on its own vessels; thus copying the
retaliatory clause of the English Navigation Repeal
Act of 1849. By Clause 7 these various articles
were made applicable to the islands of Martinique,
Guadaloupe, and Réunion (or Bourbon); and by
Clause 8, the conditions of Articles 1, 3, and 4 were
extended to Algeria; while by Article 9 the trade
between France and that colony and its Coasting trade
(<i>cabotage</i>) was permitted to be carried on by foreign
vessels under the authorisation of its governor.</p>

<p>The 10th, or last Article, of the law of 1866,
abolished the differential duties (<i>surtaxes de navigation</i>)
which had been imposed on goods imported
under a foreign flag, and the lower rate of duty on
certain commodities, imported from French warehouses,
under the flag of that country.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Repeal
Act
unsatisfactory
to
the French
Shipowners.</div>

<p>But the law of the 19th May, 1866, was very far
from giving general satisfaction in France. Many
French Shipowners were as loud in their complaints
against it as the most noted Protectionist had been
in England against the repeal of her Navigation
Laws, and with, perhaps, more valid reasons. The
new law did not give to them that freedom in the
purchase or construction of their ships they had a
right to expect. And though the duty of two francs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>per ton levied on every ship they purchased from
a foreign country was insignificant, the restrictions,
imposed on all materials necessary for the construction
and equipment of vessels in their own country,
were of a harassing and vexatious character. The
measure in itself was good, but various classes of
Protectionists, fearing that numerous articles might
be imported which could be used for other than shipbuilding
purposes, and thus interfere with their own
particular branches of trade, had influence enough
with the Legislature to obtain the issue of another
decree<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> on the 8th June following, which nullified
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>in some important respects the operation of the law
of May 1866, and rendered it less beneficial to the
people of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span></p>

<p>Under such vexatious restrictions it was impossible
for the shipbuilder of France to compete successfully
with those of other countries, as they were
nearly as prejudicial to his interests as they would
have been by the maintenance of the duties on
all the articles he required. Competition in every
branch of commerce throughout the world is so close,
that, wherever the Legislature imposes not merely
taxes but conditions, which, from their nature, must
necessarily interfere with the course of business, and
occupy a considerable portion of the shipbuilder’s
<i>time</i>, which is a part of his capital, he cannot successfully
compete with those of other countries where
no such conditions are imposed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Another
Commission
of
Inquiry
appointed,
1870.</div>

<p>Such restrictions, though in themselves comparatively
unimportant, afforded the Shipowners of France
a lever which they worked incessantly, hoping with
the aid of the other Protectionists, to overthrow in
time, the wise and liberal Act of the 19th May, or
at least to abrogate its leading principles. At last
the complaints from the seaports, and some changes
in the administration of affairs, led to the appointment
of a Commission or Parliamentary Committee,
with powers to inquire not merely into the effect of
these restrictions, but into the state generally, of the
Commercial Marine of France, and on the best means
of affording it assistance, should any be deemed
necessary or desirable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span></p>

<p>Although this Committee, which sat early in the
year 1870, never concluded its labours, its minutes
are interesting and instructive, from the depositions
and discussions they embodied, and, more especially,
from the important fact, that not a few even of the
Shipowners themselves, who had previously doubted
the policy of Free-trade as applicable to their own
interests, had, within the previous five years, become
converts to the advantages to be derived from unfettered
commerce. But the larger portion of them were,
as, in fact, Shipowners have long been in all countries,
Protectionist. They contended that the French commercial
marine was both absolutely and comparatively
in a state of decline, caused, as they argued,
mainly, by the abolition of the protective duties,
which they held were necessary to prevent them from
being ruined by foreign competition. Among the
various causes they alleged, as rendering them unable
to compete successfully with the vessels of other
nations, was the want of “bulky freights,” in consequence
of which their ships had frequently to leave
France in ballast, or with incomplete cargoes; and,
moreover, that “France, being at the western border
of Europe, English, German, and other northern
vessels, called at her ports, when not fully laden, to
complete their outward cargoes, and compete for
French freight with French shipping.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Views of
rival
parties.</div>

<p>On the other hand, the partisans of Free-trade
denied that French shipping had declined either
absolutely or in comparison with the commercial
marine of other countries. While conceding the
point that the rates of freight had diminished, they
maintained that such was the case in all other parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
of the world; that this, therefore, was not in any
way peculiar to France, such diminution of freight
being, in fact, the natural consequence of a competition
which, in the interests of the community at
large, it would be as impossible as it was undesirable
to prevent. Moreover, they showed that, where
their Shipowners had kept pace with the movements
of the age, by substituting iron for wood, and
steamers for sailing vessels, whenever the requirements
of the trade necessitated a change, and in
cases, where the masters of these vessels themselves
were enterprising and disposed to seek for freight,
wherever it could be most advantageously procured,
they had increased. Thus proving that the French
commercial marine was fully able, if relieved from
needless restrictions, to hold its own against that
of any other nation. What they required was to
have the “system of liberty more completely and
logically applied” by the alteration or abolition of
certain oppressive burdens; and by the removal of all
troublesome, onerous, and, frequently, frivolous duties
imposed by the French laws, besides a few other
reforms which they specified.</p>

<p>But those Shipowners who favoured the Free-trade
movement were, as has been the case in other countries,
assailed as traitors by the adverse party, who
taxed them with having selfish views, at variance
with the true interests of French shipping, owing to
their position of commission agents or shipbrokers,
as well as of Shipowners; and, no doubt, these two
interests were conflicting, inasmuch as the profits on
the vessels might be made subservient to other and
more lucrative sources of gain. But this is an old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
story, which has been frequently told, and those
persons who, in this instance, used it as an argument,
did not perceive that it was double-edged. Nor was
it, indeed, conclusive, as, whatever the motives which
prompted the arguments of the partisans of Free-trade,
these arguments were good and sound in
themselves. Besides, there were many shipowners
in France in favour of Free-trade who had no other
interests to serve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M. de
Coninck.</div>

<p>For example, the late M. de Coninck,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> who was
a large shipowner, in his evidence states that he had
given up every other branch of business except ship-owning—being
at the time, as he remarked, “nothing
but a carrier” (<i>charretier</i>). In other respects his
evidence was equally frank and straightforward.
The cause, he deliberately told the Commissioners,
the real cause of the complaints of the Protectionist
Shipowners was not loss, properly speaking,
but a mere diminution in their profits;<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> this loss,
certainly, had, he as frankly admitted, been reduced
by competition to an average rate, inferior to that
of the palmy days of Protection, during which, he
added, the Shipowners obtained unreasonably large
profits at the expense of the community. M. de
Coninck then gave happy illustrations of the <i>loss</i> so
called of which they so loudly complained. “Formerly,
and in my time,” he said, “it was considered
that a vessel should clear herself in three voyages!
That was the golden age of shipowners; but there is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span>no such thing now, and, when we can gain <i>ten</i> per
cent. per annum on the cost of our vessel we should
be well satisfied.”<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">M. Bergasse.</div>

<p>In support of the opinions expressed by M. de
Coninck we have the indirect testimony of a well-known
Protectionist who gave his evidence before
the Commission. M. Bergasse, himself a leading
Shipowner of Marseilles, was deputed by the Shipowners
of that important seaport to appear before
the Commission and state the hardships of their
case. He was a gentleman of high position and
considerable experience and knowledge of the
world. After attempting to show the advantages
which the Shipowners of other nations had over
those of France, he came to the old story which had
been told a thousand times in England about the
Shipowners and seamen of Norway, Sweden, and
Denmark, “accustomed,” said he, “to live poorly,
they equip their vessels in an entirely economical
manner, and <i>do not seek to make Shipowners fortunes</i>,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
but only to gain their livelihood.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">M. Siegfried.</div>

<p>M. Siegfried, a retired merchant, who followed,
gave much valuable evidence, showing the fallacy of
the system of protection as insisted on, in this instance,
by its partizans. He contended that France,
so gifted by nature, only required outlets for her
oversea commerce, a better commercial training, and
a more hardy and enterprising spirit in trade. In
the course of this portion of his evidence he stated,
as characteristic of the business deficiencies of French
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>shipmasters, that French export houses frequently
chartered English vessels in preference to those of
their own country, because the English masters were
more easy to deal with, and more accommodating in
their way of doing business. Nor were they subject
to the extreme anxieties about their responsibility
which distinguished the French shipmasters. For
instance, he said, the latter will constantly insist upon
somebody coming to take note “that bale number
so and so had been wetted in the corner,” and, by
calling attention to reserves and protests on the bills
of lading were, constantly, wearying exporters by
their troublesome and minute precautions against
responsibility.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> With regard to the demands of the
Protectionists, he strongly adjured the Commissioners
on no account to be induced to advise the resumption
of the differential duties, as any such protection to
the commercial marine of France could have no
other effect, in the end, but to increase the prosperity
of the railways and to give a fresh impetus
to the maritime prosperity of the Italian ports, on
the one hand, and of Antwerp and other ports in
the northern vicinity of France, on the other.</p>

<p>But this most excellent advice was given in vain;
and, though the Commissioners do not appear to
have made any regular report on the evidence, the
evidence itself was so full of Protectionist views that
it taught abundant Protectionist lessons to the legislators
who had to draw conclusions from it. Many
of these gentlemen are, indeed, imbued with strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
Conservative principles, and are, naturally, prone to
seize on any statement in favour of their own views
without inquiring very minutely into its soundness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M Thiers
and Protection
carry the
day,</div>

<p>Although an impression prevails that the spirit of
Protection took deeper root, than it had previously
done in the French Legislative Assembly, after the
terrible disasters of the war with Germany, the
truth is that it only manifested itself owing to the
pressure exerted by M. Thiers when he came into
power on that memorable occasion. The spirit of the
Assembly was still as much in favour of freedom of
commerce as it had been in 1860, when it passed its
famous commercial treaty with England. But the
enormous drain on the resources of France, together
with other causes, and the then all-powerful influence
of M. Thiers, who, throughout his long life,
has been an honest Protectionist in its most original
form, inspired the Assembly with a financial policy
intended to husband those resources and to make
the most of them, but, being timorous and narrow-minded
in its conception, it was by no means
calculated to attain the object in view. That such
was the case we see most clearly in the system
adopted by the New Assembly with respect to
foreign commerce, and even more especially, in
its relations with the mercantile marine of other
countries. That Assembly, in its wisdom, decided
that the commercial treaties between England, on
the one hand, and Belgium, on the other, should
be revised from a Protectionist point of view, so
as to return to the old system. Happily, however,
a proviso was introduced into the new law
which was only in conformity with the spirit of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>
Treaties of 1860, whereby it was decreed that timely
notice should be given to England and to Belgium
of any intention on the part of France to put an end
to the Treaties of 1860.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and reversed,
in
1872, much
of the law
of 1866.</div>

<p>But the Assembly had its own way with regard to
foreign shipping, and, by the laws of the 30th
January and 3rd February, 1872, it was enacted,
almost entirely through the overwhelming influence
of M. Thiers: That all goods imported in foreign
ships, except from the French colonies, were to be
charged with a <i>surtaxe de pavillon</i> per 100 kilogrammes,
according to the following scale of rates:
from the countries of Europe and the basin of the
Mediterranean, 75 centimes; from countries out of
Europe, on this side the Capes of Horn and Good
Hope, 1 franc 50 centimes; and, from all countries
beyond these Capes, 2 francs. Guano was, however,
excepted from these duties because a French mercantile
house had entered into a contract to purchase a large
quantity of it from the Peruvian Government.</p>

<p>This law further provided that all goods produced,
originally, by countries out of Europe were liable
to a <i>surtaxe d’entrepôt</i>, when imported from the
warehouses of Europe, of 3 francs per 100 kilogrammes,
unless they were, by the laws then in force,
liable to a higher duty, which, in such case, would
be charged. But, perhaps, the most suicidal portion
of this law, as affecting the French Shipowners, was
the re-imposition of from 30 to 50 francs per ton
measurement on all foreign vessels, purchased for
registration in France, together with a duty on
marine engines. Again, a tonnage duty was charged
on vessels of every flag coming from any foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
country or from the French colonies, of from 50
centimes to 1 franc per ton measurement; while
Articles 1, 3, and 5, of the law of the 19th May,
1866, were repealed.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>The object, however, of this new law seems to have
been, more especially, directed against the vessels of
those countries which were in some respect protected
by commercial treaties, and would, otherwise, have
been free from it. It was introduced by a report
of M. Ancel, of a very discouraging character,
who charged the law of 1866, which had abolished
the <i>surtaxes de pavillon</i>, with the sufferings and depression
of the French maritime interests. Among
the injurious effects attributed to that law, M. Ancel’s
report alleged the diminution of the imports under
the French flag from India and the South Seas.
Thus, he stated that, previously to 1860, the foreign
flag carried only a small portion of these goods
(they never carried any on account of the prohibitory
differential duties then in force), whereas,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>in 1869, three-fourths of them had been imported
into France in foreign vessels. Consequently, he
demanded, forgetting altogether the interests of the
consumer and manufacturer, the re-establishment of
the <i>surtaxes de pavillon</i> upon all importations, except
those under the flag of such producing countries as
were protected against <i>surtaxes</i> by the treaties of
navigation with France, at the same time, expressing
a hope that these changes would afford to the
French Mercantile marine “an encouragement and
a strength that its situation imperatively required.”<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>But it is difficult—indeed it is impossible, to understand
how the abolition of the <i>surtaxes de pavillon</i>
by the law of 1866 could have caused so much
mischief in 1869 and previously, as it was only from
the 11th of June of that year that the abolition came
into operation; and as to the <i>surtaxes d’entrepôt</i>
they had, in fact, never been set aside! It was
on such grounds as these, that the chief provisions
of the wise and liberal Merchant Shipping Act of
Napoleon III. were swept away!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Just views
of the
Duke
Decazes.</div>

<p>Happily, however, there are still many able and
shrewd men in the Councils of France—men who
were, from the first, well aware of the pernicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
effects which this law had produced upon the commerce
of their country. “It may be said,” remarks
the Duke Decazes with great truth and wisdom,
“that it is that law which has jeopardised the great
trade in corn of the port of Marseilles, in the same
way as it has directed towards Genoa the exports
of ore from the island of Elba, so valuable for our
foundries ... what has taken place in the south is
equally brought under our notice from the north,
with respect to the port of Antwerp, which has
profited by the new law to the detriment of Havre
and Dunkirk. In those seas, it is the German flag
which has now obtained the advantage, and enjoys
the freight which heretofore pertained to the shipping
of France.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Abolition,
for the
second
time, of
the <i>Surtaxes
de
Pavillon</i>,
July 1873.</div>

<p>Unanswerable facts such as these, confirming as
they did the lucid and strong opinion expressed by
M. Siegfried, showed what a nation may suffer,
if it disregard the clear teachings of political
economy applicable to all nations, and adopt such
ancient and exploded dogmas as those propounded
by M. Thiers; hence the Assembly retraced its
steps, and by the first article of the law of the
28th and 31st July, 1873, which is still in force,
the <i>surtaxes de pavillon</i> were, for the second time,
abolished.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>It is to be hoped that this practical measure will
have more effect than the disregarded admonitions
of experience and of knowledge, and that the <i>surtaxes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>
de pavillon</i> will no more find a place in the statute
book of France. For the present, vessels of all
foreign countries are placed upon the same footing as
those of France, except with respect to the Coasting
trade between its ports, from which foreign vessels
are, as a rule, excluded, except those of Spain.
Richer in agricultural products than most other
countries, and, with a population very largely engaged
in the cultivation of the soil, the French
people will, no doubt in time, see the many advantages
that they themselves would derive, were
this trade, also, thrown open to the competition of
the ships of all nations; not, that any nation could
manage it so well and profitably as themselves, resident
as they are on the spot, but, the fear of competition
from others would have a marvellous effect
in rousing French Shipowners, as it did those of
England, to greater efforts on behalf of their own
interests, apart from the interests and well-being of
their country.</p>

<p>It may thus be hoped that France will not again
be found in the crooked road of retrogression, but
that, having under innumerable difficulties and
after long years of political discussion, often in
the midst of civil wars and great changes in her
constitution, achieved victory over the antiquated
dogmas of a cumbrous and ruinous system of
protection, she will continue in the clear path of
progress, which so well becomes a nation endowed
by nature with the richest soil and finest climate
in Europe. Possessing a population, whose industrious
and frugal habits will enable her to maintain
for centuries yet to come the relatively high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span>
position she has always held among nations, her
legislators would do well to teach the people that
these great natural advantages, and not her armies,
are the true sources of the lasting greatness and
happiness of France.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_222" href="#FNanchor_222" class="label">[222]</a> This Exhibition was followed by a similar one in Paris in 1855, and,
when the Emperor Napoleon came to visit the Queen just before it was
opened the merchants of London presented him with an address.
The late Mr. Samuel Gurney was one of the deputation. After
shaking hands with those of its members whom he knew, the Emperor
remarked to Mr. Gurney that it was a long time since they had met.
“Yes, Sire,” said the fine old Quaker with one of his blandest smiles,
“it <i>is</i> a long time, and there have been many changes since then;”
having, evidently, in his mind at the time, the means, whereby his
Majesty had risen to power, and the Crimean war. “I hope,” continued
the Emperor, “you will visit our Exhibition next year, and
that you will allow me the pleasure of seeing you there.” “It is my
intention, Sire,” replied Mr. Gurney, “to visit thy great <span class="smcap">Peace
Demonstration</span>, and, should I do so, I shall not fail as thou wishest
to pay my respects to thee.” The Emperor was, doubtless, pleased
with the ready manner in which his old Quaker friend had construed
his Exhibition into a demonstration of peace, and, especially, peace
with England, which, at that time, and, as I believe throughout the
whole of his reign, he was most anxious to maintain.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_223" href="#FNanchor_223" class="label">[223]</a> The motion was as follows:—“That an humble address be presented
to her Majesty, praying that she will be graciously pleased to enter
into negotiations with the Emperor of the French with the view of
making a Treaty for the reciprocal abrogation of all discriminating
duties levied upon the vessels and their cargoes of either of the two
nations in the ports of the other; and for procuring such alterations
in the Navigation Laws of France as may tend to facilitate the commercial
intercourse, and strengthen the friendly relations between
England and France.”—See ‘Hansard’s Reports’ (March 29, 1860), vol.
clvii. pp. 1528 to 1553.</p>

<p>Having prepared and carried this resolution, I had frequently occasion
to correspond and converse with Mr. Cobden on the subject, who
said that the labour in connection with the Commercial Treaty was so
immense, that it would have been impossible to embrace the question
of navigation. Indeed, he observed that he, alone, never could have
got through with its numerous details, had it not been for the valuable
assistance rendered by Mr. (now Sir Lewis) Mallet, who, at
that time attached to the Board of Trade, accompanied him on his
mission. I can also state of my own knowledge that the services of
Mr. Mallet during the subsequent inquiry into the French Navigation
Laws were of the greatest importance. With regard to the Commercial
Treaty itself, there can be no doubt that, if the Legislatures
of England and France, of their own free will, had adopted measures
to allow the people of the respective countries to exchange their produce
and manufactures free from all duties, except such as were required
for the revenue, it would have been much preferable to the
system of “bargaining” which Treaties invariably entail; but, unfortunately,
all nations do not yet see that, if a principle is sound, it
must be beneficial wherever it is applied, and, as they are still prone
to set up their own laws in opposition to the laws of nature, no step
in advance could have been made at that time, so far as France was
concerned, without a Treaty. On the other hand, I have frequently
heard objections raised to the Treaty because France was the larger
gainer; its opponents said, to use a homely phrase, that the French
people got 9<i>d.</i>, while we got only 3<i>d.</i> out of the shilling. I offer no
opinion on this point, but even if such were the case, we are 3<i>d.</i> better
off than we should have been had no Treaty been made, and why
therefore should we cavil against it?</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_224" href="#FNanchor_224" class="label">[224]</a> I daresay many persons thought at the time that I was interfering,
where I had no business, with the affairs of Diplomacy; but the truth
was this, as I had taken upon myself the responsibility of the motion
which the House of Commons adopted, Lord Russell felt, that I ought
to go a step further, and do what I could to carry it into effect, more
especially, as the whole question was one full of technical details.
Indeed, Lord Cowley frankly stated that it was so technical in its
character, that he did not feel competent to bring it under the notice
of the French Government, and, in justice to his Lordship, I must state
that, so far from feeling that I was interfering with his duties, he, not
merely, rendered every assistance in his power, but was most anxious
that I should succeed in the object of my self-imposed mission. The
advantages I possessed were a practical knowledge of the subject in
all its bearings and details—a slight personal knowledge of the
Emperor which I had gained when I had an interview with him about
his transport service during the Crimean war, and, more especially, the
friendship of Michel Chevalier, through whom I became acquainted
with M. Rouher, the then Minister of Commerce.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_225" href="#FNanchor_225" class="label">[225]</a> Having consulted with Messrs. Rouher and Chevalier as to the
most advisable course to pursue, and, seeing with them the difficulties
which had to be overcome, I had resolved with their entire consent—indeed
on their suggestion—to seek an audience with the Emperor
himself, a course which so thoroughly met the approval of Lord Cowley,
that he, at once, undertook to obtain it, and, himself, to accompany me
to the Tuileries. I had learned from the “tossing of the horses’
heads” what an apt scholar I was about to meet, and that any
imperfect arguments or inconclusive facts would be at once detected.
Consequently, I had carefully rehearsed in my mind every point necessary
to bring under his notice, and had taken all my figures from the
<i>French Official Returns</i>. At first the subject, necessarily a dry one, did
not seem to interest the Emperor, but, when I called his attention to the
fact that, while the sailing-ships of Great Britain had been increased
during the previous twenty years by 2,800,000 tons, and her steamers
by 400,000 tons, those of France had only, in that time, been increased
by 370,000 tons, and 50,000 tons respectively, though her general
commerce, in every other branch, increased nearly as rapidly as our
own, he asked me to repeat the figures and explain, why it was that
there was such an enormous difference. The task was an easy one;
but, perhaps, the facts which struck him most were, that, though the
Shipowners of France were carefully protected at a loss to the community,
as more than one-half of the whole of her oversea carrying
trade was conducted by foreign vessels owing to the differential
duties, her people were really paying greatly enhanced prices for everything
they required from abroad, without adding one sixpence to his
revenue.</p>

<p>The interview, which, altogether, lasted for nearly two hours, must,
however, have made a considerable impression on the Emperor, for, on
parting, he requested me to put in writing, and in a letter addressed
to himself, the leading facts and figures I had brought under his
notice, and to let him have it that evening, if convenient. I made it
convenient, and by 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> of that day he received the letter, a copy of
which will be found in the <a href="#Appendix4">Appendix, No. 4,</a> p. 582.</p>

<p>On the following morning, I received a note from his private secretary,
M. Mocquard, saying that the Emperor wished to see me that forenoon
alone. After communicating with Lord Cowley, I waited upon his
Majesty, and his first expression was, “I have read your letter more
than once, and I wish you to explain more fully the effect of the Navigation
Laws.” That I might convey to his mind, effectually, the operation
of all such laws, I asked for the use of a Mercator chart on a large scale,
which was soon obtained, and, spreading it on the floor, I drew upon it,
with a pencil, lines to explain, for instance, the usual course of commerce
with India, by way of Egypt as well as by the Cape of Good Hope.
I then showed him that, though our steamers and sailing-ships were
constantly passing his chief ports of Havre and Marseilles laden with
produce, of which his people might be in the greatest want, the
differential duties imposed by his laws prevented us from landing
these goods; and then, turning to his own official returns, I repeated
the fact that not one franc of revenue was derived from these dues; so
that, while his people were heavy losers on one hand, his exchequer
was not benefited on the other. To obtain the sugar, coffee, indigo,
and other articles with which, for instance, a Peninsular and Oriental
steamer passing his port of Marseilles was laden, it was necessary that
they should be carried through the Straits of Gibraltar (still tracing the
lines on the chart), cross the Bay of Biscay, pass his other great port
of Havre, and be carried on to Southampton, to be there landed, and,
most likely, sent by railway to London, where they were bonded, and
thence shipped again in either French or English vessels for Calais or
Boulogne, and then conveyed across France to wherever they might be
required by his people; possibly even to Marseilles or Havre. “Now,
Sire,” I said, still kneeling on the chart and looking earnestly at the
Emperor, “if your people prefer to have what Indian produce they
need conveyed to them, in that very roundabout and expensive manner,
instead of importing it direct in whatever vessels may be ready to
carry the produce to them on the most favourable terms, it is a process
to which I, as an Englishman, have no objections to offer, for we carry
in our ships not merely the great bulk of the Indian produce, but
have also much extra profit from it in the shape of landing, bonding,
railway carriage, transhipment, commissions, and so forth; I do not,
however, see how your manufacturers can compete successfully with
those of other countries, if they are compelled by your Navigation
Laws to import the raw material they require by such antiquated and
expensive modes as these.”</p>

<p>As the room, in which we were was small and the light not very
good, the Emperor had followed my example, and, that he might see
the lines and ports more distinctly, had himself, before I concluded,
knelt down also on the chart.</p>

<p>In the palaces of France are to be found many grand pictures
descriptive of the wars of the Empire, but its artists may now add
to the decoration of these walls a far grander and nobler scene, and
represent their last Emperor performing a duty to his people of much
greater importance as regards their future welfare and happiness,
and far more worthy of record than the blood-stained fields of Magenta
and Solferino. I had, subsequently, frequent occasion to see the
Emperor on the subject of these laws; and I gave evidence, for the
same purposes, before the <i>Conseil Supérieur</i> he appointed to inquire
into them: in the report of these proceedings there will be found a
copy of my letter to his Majesty, and also a copy of one addressed
to M. Fleury on the same subject. (See <a href="#Appendix5">Appendix</a> to this volume,

of the dues.</p>

<p>Art. 4. Importers must engage, by an undertaking guaranteed in
due form, to prove, within a period not exceeding one year, that the
raw material admitted free, or the products manufactured with such
material, or, finally, the machines and machinery, detached portions
of machines, and other articles completely finished and temporarily
admitted free, have been applied to the use of vessels.</p>

<p>If, at the expiration of the term of one year, the before-mentioned
proofs have not been produced, the Custom-house will collect the
official fees, and take steps for their recovery, conformably to the third

the weight of each kind of metal.</p>

<p>Art. 7. The Custom-house, in order to check the declarations set
out of the employment, whether as to raw material or manufactured
articles, shall make use of whatever mode of proceeding it may judge
necessary.</p>

accounts, made up with materials of a degree of manufacture less
advanced than that of the articles tendered for entry.</p>

<p>Art. 9. Products manufactured with raw materials introduced duty
free must represent those same materials weight for weight, and
without any allowance for waste.</p>

<p>Art. 10. All infractions of the provisions of the present Decree will
be followed by the application of the penalties provided under the third

<p><a id="Footnote_236" href="#FNanchor_236" class="label">[236]</a> It may be remembered that when the Assembly rejected certain
important clauses of this foolish Bill, M. Thiers resigned. He, however,
knew full well that at that moment the Assembly would submit
to his wishes sooner than let itself be deprived of his services. It was
only, therefore, in subserviency to him, that the retrogressive law of
1872 passed the Assembly. It may have been the case that, at this
period of disorder and financial pressure, there was a rush of Protectionists
to propound their schemes for raising revenues—schemes
for making other people pay these debts—the cherished but delusive
theories of bygone ages; but the main spring of action was the influence
of M. Thiers. He was <i>the</i> Government of the day. He abhorred
any opinions different from his own well-known principles in favour
of Protection, which he urged with all his might, and, being then
all-powerful, he carried the Assembly with him; and, that such
was the case, is clearly evident from the fact that, immediately
after his overthrow, the laws he had forced upon France were changed,
and the limited liberties of its people, which he had removed, were
again restored.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_237" href="#FNanchor_237" class="label">[237]</a> The fact, as I learn from my friend M. Michel Chevalier, connected
with this Committee of Inquiry—the evidence before which was made
the basis of Thiers’ measure—was that Pouyer-quertier, though not a
member of it, exercised so much influence with its chairman, M. Paulmier,
a deputy of Calvados, that he, being constantly in attendance with
witnesses of strong Protectionist views, prevailed on him to put such
questions to them, as would make it appear that Free-trade was
ruining France. Witnesses of Liberal views, as I have shown, could
hardly be heard. Nevertheless, the Committee, as I have already
observed, came to no conclusion, and no report was made beyond the
informal one of M. Ancel.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_238" href="#FNanchor_238" class="label">[238]</a> M. Thiers, it may be remembered, was thrown out of office May 24,
1873, and, as this Bill was passed on the 31st of July, or only two
months after his fall, his political opinions cannot have left much impression
on the Assembly which had so recently been under his
dictatorship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recent
legislation
relating
to the
loss of life
and property
at
sea in
British
vessels.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Committee
on shipwrecks
of
1836.</div>

<p>Great Britain having by her example shown to
other nations the advantages to be derived from free
navigation and unfettered commerce, and having relieved
her shipowners from nearly all the burdens
of which protection was the origin, directed her
attention in a more special manner than had hitherto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span>
been done to the safety of life and property at sea.
No doubt she had been ever mindful of her seamen
and, from the earliest records of her history, a just
pride has been felt in those who protect her sea-girt
homes; but it is only in recent years that any organised
system has been adopted to reduce the disasters
of a naturally hazardous profession, or that the Legislature
has seriously devoted itself to the provision of
measures whereby the proverbial dangers of the sea
may be lessened. Very little attention, indeed, had
been paid to this important subject until 1836, when
a Committee of the House of Commons was appointed
to inquire into shipwrecks, the result being that certain
facts were, for the first time, brought prominently
under public notice in a practical manner. These
facts are interesting and instructive, especially when
viewed by the light of subsequent experience.</p>

<p>There being then, however, no reliable statistics
of the extent of the loss of life and property at sea,
the Committee were obliged to depend on information
from other than official sources; hence, it was only
from the records of Lloyd’s, supplemented by estimates
of their own, that they were able to compare
the casualties of 1816-18 with those of 1833-35, the
three years previous to their inquiry. Nor was this
comparison complete. To make it so, it would have
been necessary to compare, not merely the actual
amounts of loss at the two periods, but the proportion
the amounts bore relatively to the amount of life
and property exposed to danger. There were, however,
then no means of obtaining these with accuracy,
as the returns were imperfect as regards the number
of vessels, their sizes, and the number of persons they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span>
carried, an imperfection arising, in a great measure,
from the fact that many vessels, which in 1816 had
ceased to exist, were still retained on the registry.
Though the entries and clearances of British ships
engaged in trade between the United Kingdom and
her colonies, and foreign countries, could at both
periods be obtained with accuracy, there were no
certain returns of the amount of tonnage and of the
number of men engaged in the Coasting trade, as the
Customs did not take any notice of vessels sailing in
ballast or with cargoes of a certain description. Nor
do we even now know the actual amount of the
shipping and men engaged in this particular trade
with anything like perfect accuracy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Estimated
loss of life
at sea between
1818 and
1836.</div>

<p>Thus it was impossible to arrive at a correct comparative
estimate of the increase, or otherwise, of
the loss of life at sea at any given periods previous
to 1835. I may, however, state that the Committee,
with the best information they could obtain, arrived
at the conclusion that while the loss of life for the
three years previous to 1818 had averaged 763 persons
per annum, it had increased to 894 per annum
for the three years previous to 1835, though the
tonnage of vessels belonging to the United Kingdom
was actually less at the latter than it had been at
the former period.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The amount of tonnage, however, in itself, even
when correct, is an imperfect criterion; indeed, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span>obtain anything like accuracy we ought to have
before us, not merely the number of entries and
clearances,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> but the actual number of persons conveyed
by sea; for, without such data, we cannot hope
to ascertain the comparative loss of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recommendations
of
the Committee.</div>

<p>The Committee of 1836 had, nevertheless, sufficient
information before them to arrive at certain sound
conclusions; the more important of these being that
the increase of disasters at sea arose, in a great measure,
from the imperfect classification of ships which
had existed up to 1834 (when the improved Society
of Lloyd’s Register was instituted) depending, as it
had, almost exclusively on the age of the vessel; from
the bad forms of vessels, arising from the defective
system of admeasurement for tonnage dues, and from
the shallow harbours where ships lay aground and
were strained. The Committee likewise attributed
the losses to the incompetency of masters and officers,
and to their habits of intemperance, as well as to that
of the crews; to the system of marine insurance; to
the want of harbours of refuge; to the imperfection
of charts;<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and, strange to add, to the “competition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>with foreign shipowners, who, from the many advantages
enjoyed by them in the superior cheapness
of their materials for building, equipping, and provisioning
their vessels, and in the lower rate of
wages paid to their crews, were enabled to realise
profits on terms of freight which would not even
cover the expenses of British ships.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Committee
of 1843—loss
of
lives and
ships at
that
period.</div>

<p>The next Committee appointed to inquire into shipwrecks
commenced their investigation in 1843, and
the returns made up from the evidence before them
show that in the previous three years the annual
average loss of vessels was 611, of 128,678 tons, and
766 lives, out of 22,977 ships, of 2,908,737 tons
belonging to the United Kingdom, and of 37,380
of such ships, of 6,730,242 tons entered and cleared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</span>
in the foreign trade of this country, so that, while
the intercourse with other countries had very materially
increased, the loss of life had been only a
fraction more than it was in the three years previously
to 1818.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First
official
return of
wrecks,
1856.</div>

<p>But as we have no accurate and continuous official
record, even of the wrecks happening on our own
coasts, till 1856, when the Board of Trade for the
first time published its return, and, as there is no
official record of the wrecks of British ships in other
parts of the world until 1865, little reliance, beyond
an approximate comparison, can be placed on the
full extent of the casualties at sea till that period.
In some measure they were guess work, and, as
numerous vessels were no doubt lost of which no
record of any kind had been kept until about the
year 1836, the probabilities are that the loss of life
was greater than the estimates of it made out by the
Committees of 1836 or even of 1843.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loss of
life and
ships, 1862</div>

<p>We have, however, a return<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> for the three years
previously to 1863 much more complete and accurate
than any earlier ones, on which reliance may be
placed, showing that, on an average in each of these
years, 1004 ships, of 251,000 tons, belonging to the
<i>British Empire</i>, and 1316 lives were lost. The
average number of ships on the register in these
years belonging to the <i>whole Empire</i> was 38,932, of
5,882,565 tons, and the British ships entered and
cleared in the foreign trade of the United Kingdom
were 56,997, of 15,094,105 tons.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">and 1873.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Percentage
of loss
of life, 1833
to 1873.</div>

<p>The last return,<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> made for 1871-3 inclusive shows
that the average number of ships lost in each of these
three years was 1095, of 319,790 tons, and of lives
was 1952; the number of ships belonging to the
British Empire being then 37,086, of 7,168,618 tons,
and the entries and clearances of vessels engaged in
the foreign trade of the United Kingdom being
73,783 vessels, of 27,275,339 tons. No doubt this
return shows a sacrifice of life which every humane
or right-minded person must wish to mitigate, as
to desire to save life has now happily become one
of the highest objects of ambition among nations
who are truly civilised, but, considering the number
of vessels afloat, and the enormous increase in the
entries and clearances, it, at the same time, shows
a very considerable comparative reduction on the
losses of previous years so far as they can be ascertained
or estimated, more especially when we consider
that previous returns included only the vessels
belonging to the United Kingdom, whereas the later
ones embrace the tonnage of the whole of the
British Empire then greatly increased, and that,
too, by steam vessels, increasing the risk of disaster
to a serious extent by the rapidity of their movements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
recommendations.</div>

<p>But to this important question I shall more fully
refer hereafter. In the meantime I may state that,
among the various other recommendations offered by
the Committee of 1836, may be mentioned the formation
of a Mercantile Marine Board; the compilation
and consolidation of a Code of Mercantile Marine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span>
Laws; the improved classification of ships; nautical
schools; courts of inquiry into shipwrecks; tribunals
for the settlement of disputes; savings-banks for
seamen, and asylums for them in old age or when
unfit for duty; and, above all, “discouragement of
drinking on board,” while attention was called “to
the vast superiority in officers, crews, and equipments,
and to the consequent superior success and
growth of American shipping.”</p>

<p>To remedy many of these evils various Acts of
Parliament were passed, to most of which I have
already referred, and, presently, I shall refer at length
to the great changes for the better made since then
in the classification of our ships by Lloyd’s Register
and other private associations; but some years elapsed
before the more important of these recommendations
were carried into effect. In the meantime, the new
organisation in connection with the classification of
ships, which had been established in 1834, stirred up,
no doubt, by the report of the Committee, was laying
the foundation for that career of success which has
since attended its efforts. Other similar associations
followed; one in Liverpool, which was afterwards
amalgamated with Lloyd’s Register, and the <i>Veritas</i>,
a foreign association, still carrying on its useful work
in this country, though to a limited extent, but
largely in Canada, as well as on the Continent and in
the United States of America.</p>

<p>The Committee of 1843, confirming the recommendations
of its predecessor in 1836, added to
them the survey of passenger ships; amendments
in the law of pilotage, the establishment of signals
by sound at the principal lighthouses, and of rocket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span>
and mortar apparatuses for the saving of life on
different parts of the coast; the supply of life-buoys
and belts in case of shipwreck; the carrying of life-boats
in all passenger vessels; a revision of the laws
and administration for the protection from plunder
of wrecked property; international regulations for
vessels meeting at sea, and a code of laws for the
guidance and protection of seamen. All of these
recommendations, and many others for the protection
of life and property at sea, have since been carried
into effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Various
laws for
the protection
of
seamen,
1846 to
1854.</div>

<p>In 1846, and again in 1848, further Acts were
passed having the same laudable object in view,
and these, with all the other Acts, including the
important Act of 1850, to which I have already
referred at length,<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> were carefully revised and improved
by the great Act of 1854, and by subsequent
measures. Nor have the health and interests of
seamen, as well as the preservation of their lives
from shipwreck, been overlooked in this mass of
legislation. In 1835, a register office for seamen
and apprentices was established, but the system,
not answering the objects in view, was abolished
in 1853. By the Acts of 1844<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> and 1845<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> seamen
were enabled to recover their wages summarily,
and they were, for the first time, protected from
imposition at the hands of crimps. By these laws,
all merchant ships were required to carry a sufficient
supply of medicine, as also of lime-juice for
the use of the crew; and, by the Act of 1854,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span>the proceedings for the recovery of wages were
made still more summary, so that, under our present
maritime laws, seamen have special remedies
for the recovery of their wages, together with a lien
on the ship not granted to any other class of the
community. Beyond the advantages of savings-banks
and money-order offices, specially for their use, a
system has been established, through the medium of
the shipping offices and the consulates abroad, under
which, seamen, when paid off, can remit their wages
without expense to their relatives at any port in the
United Kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Agitation
about
“unseaworthy
ships,”
1855.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Further
provisions
for the
benefit of
seamen,</div>

<p>In 1855, a question arose very similar to that
which has recently arisen regarding “unseaworthy
ships,” as to whether seamen could be compelled to
go to sea in them. The opinion of the law-officers
of the Crown taken by the Board of Trade was
given in favour of the seaman’s right to refuse to
sail in such vessels, and this opinion, having been
sent to the magistrates at the seaports, has ever since
been acted on, though it has been frequently abused
by unprincipled seamen, who have alleged unseaworthiness
as an excuse for being relieved from their
engagements, more especially in cases where they
have received a payment of wages in advance, or
where they have thought they could improve their
position. Nor did the efforts of the Board of Trade,
the permanent officers of which have been frequently
charged with neglecting the interests of seamen, here
end. In 1864, that Board, aware of the difficulty
seamen accused of desertion might have in proving
unseaworthiness, recommended the Home Office to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</span>inform the magistrates that, in all such cases, their
surveyors would be at the disposal of the magisterial
bench for the purposes of survey, so that seamen
might have, <i>at the expense of the community</i>, what
no other class is allowed, easy and ready means of
inquiring into their complaints by officers remunerated
by the Crown, and, consequently, an economical
and prompt dispensation of justice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1867,</div>

<p>In 1867, another Act was passed, specially for
the benefit of seamen, known as the Health Act,<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
which made further provision for the inspection and
safe custody of lime-juice or other anti-scorbutics, and
for serving these out in proper quantities and with
regularity to the crews of merchant ships. Provision
was also made in this Bill, compelling shipowners to
bear all expenses connected with a seaman’s illness,
when not brought about by his own fault or misconduct,
and for securing him increased and improved
accommodation on board ship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1869,
1870.</div>

<p>Nor did the good intention of the Government
and its regard for the interests of seamen end even
here. In the Merchant Shipping Code Consolidation
Bill,<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> first introduced on the 9th August, 1869, by
Mr. Lefevre, on behalf of Government, there is a provision
(Clause 278) enabling seamen, charged with
desertion or other crimes, to demand and obtain an
official survey of the ship from which they have
thought it expedient to quit without leave!—a provision
so very liberal in their favour as to resemble,
on the part of the Government, almost encouragement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span>of the offence of desertion. In this Bill we have also
a clause (334) which, for the first time in our legislation,
requires every shipmaster to make an official
record of the draught of water of the vessel under
his charge when leaving port. And the Bill, when
again introduced in 1870, repeated, with modifications
still further in favour of seamen charged with
desertion, their power to demand “impartial survey;”
while it enables the officers of the Board of Trade to
take and record the draught of water of any sea-going
ship, and makes it a misdemeanour on the part of
any shipowner who sends his ship to sea in an unseaworthy
state, for which he may be <i>criminally</i>
punished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr.
Samuel
Plimsoll,
M.P.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His first
resolution,
1870.</div>

<p>It was in the Session of 1870 that Mr. Plimsoll<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
first submitted his views to Parliament respecting
the loss of life and property at sea, by moving a
resolution calling in general terms for legislation on
this subject, as if no legislation had, up to that period,
been even attempted, still more carried out. I cannot
but commend the laudable objects he evidently
had in view, but, on that occasion, they were, so far
as I can judge from the Reports of ‘Hansard,’
somewhat vaguely expressed. Nor did he even then
mention (as if ignoring or unaware of the fact) that,
in that very Session, Government had introduced the
stringent Bill to which I have just referred respecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span>unseaworthy ships. His resolution, requiring a <i>compulsory</i>
load-line and the survey of all ships, was
withdrawn.</p>

<p>The Government, however, spared no exertion to
perfect the Shipping Code, which had twice been
submitted to the consideration of Parliament; and
having, during the recess, forwarded copies of it for
approval and amendment to various Shipping and
Seamen’s Associations throughout the kingdom, they
again introduced it on the opening of the Session of
1871,<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> accompanied by a memorandum,<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> calling attention
to the alterations which had been made in the
existing laws. The Bill, as re-introduced in 1871,
besides providing for the transfer of the supervision of
emigrant ships to the Board of Trade, which was carried
out in the following year, contained clauses for
the compulsory marking the draught of water on the
stem and stern of every ship, for recording the draught,
for making it a crime to send unseaworthy vessels to
sea, and for enabling seamen, charged with desertion,
to obtain, with even greater facility than they had
hitherto done, a survey of the ships in which they
had engaged to serve. Indeed, it went still further,
and, for the first time, gave the Board of Trade alone
the power of preventing any ship from proceeding
to sea if, in the opinion of its officers, there were
defects in her hull liable to render her unseaworthy:
a further provision was very properly
added to prevent an owner changing the name
of his ship without the consent of the Board of
Trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Introduces

<div class="sidenote">Government

<p>But in that year, 1871, Mr. Plimsoll, not satisfied
with the course of legislation, introduced a Bill
having the same objects in view as his resolution of
the previous Session, which, however, was also withdrawn,
Government agreeing to introduce a separate
Bill, as they had been unable to pass their Merchant
Shipping Code Bill, containing the clauses of the
larger measure relating to draught of water and
surveys. Accordingly, before the close of the Session
a short Bill was introduced and passed<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> with these
provisions, but with very little discussion, on account
of the lateness of the Session. In this Bill the clause
giving seamen charged with desertion a right to a
survey, was justly modified by confining the right to
cases where the complaint of unseaworthiness is made
by one-fourth of the crew; or if they exceed twenty
by not less than five, and to cases where a complaint
of unseaworthiness had been made by them before
quitting the ship. The power of ordering a survey
was also given to naval courts abroad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Plimsoll
publishes
a
book,
‘Our Seamen,’
1873.</div>

<p>Although these amendments had, as I have shown,
been for some years contemplated by Government,
and had been, in fact, submitted for the consideration
of Parliament before Mr. Plimsoll expressed any
opinion on the subject, they did not satisfy his
demands; and in order that his views might become
more extensively known, he published in January,
1873, a curious book.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> It is of that sensational class
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</span>which at present, either in the shape of novels or
other works of a more pretentious character, evidently
commands a large circulation among the light-reading
public. But, besides its sensational character, it
contains a great deal of information new to the ordinary
reader, who, if he does not understand its technicalities,
which Mr. Plimsoll himself does not seem
to have very well understood, will be struck by its
illustrations of decayed timbers, worm-eaten planks,
and corroded bolts. It begins with a facsimile of a
policy of insurance with the names and amount of
risk attached, and the underwriters’ “slip” on which
the policy was based, with the signatures crossed out
as they were subscribed to the policy. His object
in giving the numerous names in detail, and the
amount of the liability of each, was, as he states, “in
order to show how the responsibility is so divided
and spread as to leave no one individual a risk large
enough to be worth fighting to escape, even if there
were adequate grounds for disputing the subsequent
claim,” and, from these premises, he arrives at the
conclusion that the interest of each underwriter is so
small, that where a claim is made, it is not sufficient
“to induce any one to fight a lawsuit in order to
escape it,” even when there is “more than a suspicion
of its injustice.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately his statement, on this point, is at
variance with fact; for, though the risk of each individual
may be small, their interest, as a body, in
resisting unjust claims, and resisting them frequently
in the most strenuous manner, is too great to allow
such claims to be settled unquestioned. Mr. Plimsoll
might not, however, have been aware that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span>
Underwriters of Lloyd’s are thoroughly organised
for the purpose of grappling with such matters,
having their agents at all the principal seaports of
the world, with every facility for readily obtaining
information respecting the cause of losses, and the
nature and character of the claims made upon them;
nor of the important fact that they not merely resist
claims, as may be frequently seen in our courts
of law, but are occasionally prosecutors in the case
of fraudulent losses. So that it is altogether a
mistake to describe the Underwriters of Lloyd’s, much
less of the marine insurance companies, as a weak
body of men, whom a shipowner can “bully” into an
unjust settlement.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> The photographs he supplied were,
however, so curious in themselves, and so novel to the
public, generally, and especially to many members of
the House of Commons, and his statements, though
sometimes hap-hazard, were given with such evidently
honest intentions, that his book attracted unusual
notice.</p>

<p>But, however well-disposed the House of Commons
may have been to listen to him, and to the recommendations
in his book, the Bill he introduced for its
consideration could not possibly be entertained with
any regard to the great maritime interests of this
country, nor could they be adopted without full
inquiry; indeed, they were little short of a transfer
of the construction and management of the whole of
the shipping of Great Britain from the owners to
some department of the Government, which was to
survey every ship built, and every ship sent to sea.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span></p>
<p>From his own showing, no such extraordinary and
sweeping measure was necessary, for he admits, in a
curious and very incidental manner, that only a very
small proportion of the shipowners of this country
require to be thus controlled; indeed he states,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> “I
have heard one shipowner say that, if a small number
of well-known shipowners were put aboard one of
their own vessels when she was ready for sea, we
should, in the event of bad weather, see that with
them had disappeared from our annals nine-tenths of
the losses we all deplore!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">An extension
of the
principle
applied to
testing of
chain
cables
strongly
urged.</div>

<p>But Mr. Plimsoll, in his general statements, only
repeated, though in a more sensational and striking
manner, arguments which have for years been used
in the House of Commons. There has long been a
constant cry from a certain portion of the public for
Government interference and control; and in Parliament
there are always to be found well-meaning
representatives of the people, who think that every
evil in this wicked world can be remedied by legislative
enactments, or Crown supervision. I may
mention one instance out of many, viz.: the Act
for testing chain cables and anchors, to which I have
already referred,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> which was forced upon the Board
of Trade by the House of Commons. Returns, I
am aware, can be produced to show that since this
Testing Act came into operation, nine or ten years
ago, there have been fewer disasters than before, as
the result of inferior ground tackle. But figures can
be arranged to prove almost anything; and I shall
not stop to examine those which have been produced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</span>to prove that the chain and anchor manufacturers
of this country required to be placed under
the immediate control of the Board of Trade. It
will be a dark day for the mechanics of Great Britain
when this system prevails, and we may then abandon
all hope of ever becoming, what we have long aimed to
be, the workshop of the world. But what I cannot
too strongly condemn is, the principle of appointing
Government officials—too frequently underpaid—to
superintend or inspect the work of the manufacturer
and to regulate the standard of merit. If a manufacturer
can produce an article which, by some means or
other, is able to pass inspection, it is a matter, now,
of far less consequence than formerly to make it of
the best description, as, in the case of accident, he
screens himself behind the official certificate of its
merit. Besides, the test Government, originally,
adopted too often destroyed in a great measure the
elasticity of chain cables<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>—a quality of the utmost
importance to a ship riding at anchor in a heavy
sea-way. I quite admit that many vessels and too
many lives have been lost through inferior anchors
and cables; but a still larger number of vessels have
been sacrificed by defective construction, decayed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span>timbers, inferior spars, ropes, and sails, or insufficient
stores; and, if the principle of Government interference
is correct in the one case, it ought to be
extended to the others.</p>

<p>But this system of Government supervision would
not end here. An inspection of every chain and
anchor manufactory falls far short of the demands
of thousands of well-meaning people, who wish to
see some potent Board of Trade testing-machines permanently
established in every dockyard in the kingdom,
as if our shipbuilders knew nothing whatever
about the business, or had all arrived at the conclusion
that honesty was no longer the best policy, and
that the only sure road to riches was to cheat their
customers. Nor would even that extension of Government
control satisfy them. An estimable friend
of mine, a Vice-Admiral in H.M.’s service and a
man of learning and of great practical knowledge,
asks me in a note I received from him not long
since—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Should there not be some more stringent provisions with
respect to the inspection of sailing vessels? It is an old proverb,
‘Who ever saw a dead donkey?’ But who ever saw an
old sailing-ship broken up? I am inclined to think that it is
more to the interest of small owners to let an old tub go on shore
than to bring her safe into port. This works two evils:—1, the
danger to human life; 2, the greater rate of insurance on honest
owners to make up an average for the dishonest. Should there
not be a Board of Trade inspection as to seaworthiness: 1, of
every ship once a year; 2, of every ship absent from Great
Britain or Ireland over a year continuously, on her return; 3, of
every ship where it appears, on her arrival in port, that she had
been on shore or had suffered from heavy weather?”</p>
</div>

<p>Now there is no doubt that the evils of which my
friend complains do exist, and the remedy he proposes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</span>
has been advocated by many persons besides
himself. But would Government inspection, even if
practicable, remove or materially tend to mitigate
the evil? A very large proportion of the vessels
owned in the United Kingdom are now classed either
at Lloyd’s or elsewhere, and are periodically inspected;
and to the possibility of extending this system, a
much more feasible one than any extension of the
principle of Government supervision, I shall hereafter
refer. Unless a vessel is classed, an underwriter,
as a rule, will not take a risk on her, and,
unless she is fully insured, it is not the interest of
the owner to lose her. In the case of clubs or
mutual associations, it would be impossible to have
a better watch kept on the vessels admitted, as each
member and each person connected with these associations
adopts, for his own interest, if for no higher
motive, every possible precaution, as, in the event of
loss, he becomes a sufferer.</p>

<p>However great the evil, and however lamentable
the losses annually occurring on our shores, any very
material extension of the legislation now in force, can
do little to remedy them. The remedy is in the hands
of those persons who are most deeply interested, in that
they are certain to become the heaviest sufferers from
every loss. It is true that no ship ought to be allowed
to proceed to sea which is unseaworthy, but it is the
business of all insurance associations to see that the
vessels they insure are seaworthy; and no punishment
Government could inflict for neglect, would
be heavier than that which the owner of an uninsured
ship sustains when she is lost, or than that
which falls on members of clubs, who admit worthless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span>
vessels to their mutual-insurance associations. My
experience (and it is not a short one now) teaches
me that nearly all legislation in this direction, is
unsound in principle; and, as a rule, pernicious in
practice. I think, for instance, that we have already
erred in the attempt before noticed to measure the
standard of merit in the case of anchors and chains,
although we may have improved in the mode of
testing them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Royal

ships,
1873-4.</div>

<p>However, the House of Commons, ever ready to
listen to the appeals of humanity, and with the most
laudable desire to do what it could to save life and
to mitigate the disasters incidental to seafaring pursuits,
was fairly disposed to legislate even further in
this direction, should it really appear that fresh
legislation was necessary; hence, accepting in Mr.
Plimsoll an earnest, if not a wise counsellor, of
measures for the grandest of all objects—the saving
of human life—the House, stimulated by his recent
work, unanimously approved of his address to Her
Majesty, who was graciously pleased not merely to
grant the Commission he had prayed for, but to
place upon it “her most dear son and counsellor
Alfred Ernest Albert, Duke of Edinburgh,” who,
himself a sailor, was fully competent to understand
the nature of the inquiry, and had a fellow-feeling
for the sailors of all classes, on whose behalf the
appeal was made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its members.</div>

<p>No Commission in our time has consisted of more
able and impartial members. Besides His Royal
Highness, it had as chairman the Duke of Somerset,
a nobleman of shrewd sense and of very sound judgment,
who had been First Lord of the Admiralty;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</span>
Mr. Liddell (now Lord Eslington), who represented
a large maritime constituency, and had for years
directed his attention with unwearied zeal to all seafaring
questions; Mr. Milner Gibson, who had filled
the office of President of the Board of Trade; Sir
James Hope, an Admiral of great experience; Mr.
Rothery, the Registrar of the Admiralty Court; Mr.
Cohen, a well-known barrister-at-law; Mr. Denny,
an eminent shipbuilder; Mr. George Duncan, an
experienced Shipowner, and a member of the Committee
of Lloyd’s Register; Mr. Edgell, of the Trinity
House; and Mr. C. W. Merrifield, F.R.S. and late
Principal of the Royal School of Naval Architecture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
order of
reference</div>

<p>By such a Commission the most searching inquiry
was to be instituted “with regard to the alleged
unseaworthiness of British registered ships, whether
arising form overloading, deck-loading, defective construction,
form equipment, machinery, age, or improper
stowage.” The Commission was also instructed
“to inquire into the present system of marine insurance;
the state of the law as to the liability of
shipowners for injury to those whom they employ,
and also the alleged practice of under-manning ships;
they were likewise to suggest any amendments of
the law which might remedy or lessen such evils
as may be found to have arisen from the matters
aforesaid.”</p>

<p>A careful analysis of Mr. Plimsoll’s statements
showed that he attributed the causes of shipwreck to
unseaworthiness, owing to want of repair; overloading,
which includes the carriage of cargo on deck;
under-manning; bad stowage; inadequate engine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</span>
power; over-insurance; defective construction, and
undue length; and, that a full half of the losses arose
from two of these causes, first, that “a great number
of ships are regularly sent to sea in such a rotten
and otherwise ill-provided state that they can only
reach their destination through fine weather;” and,
secondly, that “a large number are so overloaded
that it is nearly impossible for them also to reach
their destination if the voyage is at all rough.”</p>

<p>As I have already endeavoured to show, the
“Merchant Shipping Consolidated Act” of 1854,
with its 548 clauses, was passed expressly for the
purpose of remedying by law, as far as practicable,
existing evils, and the amended Acts of 1855, 1862,
1871, and 1873 had the same object in view; so
that there was in force, at the time when the Commission
commenced its inquiry, a mass of legislation,
which, in itself, ought to have been amply
sufficient to prevent and punish the offences alleged
to be committed. Indeed, conscientious Shipowners
have been heard to say that they were appalled at the
numerous instances in which they had found themselves
law breakers, from the simple impossibility
of bearing in mind, owing to the number of Acts
in force, their legal duties. Yet, if Mr. Plimsoll’s
recommendations had been carried into effect, the
manifold legislation, then in force, would have been
very much increased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and mode
of
thorough
investigation.</div>

<p>Happily, however, the Commission saw, after
thoroughly examining the whole subject, that it was
not by increase of legislation, that such evils could
be remedied, but by a more effectual application of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</span>
the law as it then stood. In their reports<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> they express
an opinion, that much misapprehension appears
to exist about what is meant by unseaworthiness, so,
before offering any recommendation with the view
of preserving human life at sea, they prefaced their
observations with a few practical and sensible remarks
on what constitutes unseaworthiness.</p>

<p>The safety of a ship at sea, they remark, with great
force, cannot be secured by any one precaution or set
of precautions, but requires the unceasing application
of skill, care, and vigilance, from her first
design to her unloading at the port of destination.
To be seaworthy, she must be well designed, well
constructed, well equipped, well stowed, and, above
all, well manned and well navigated; otherwise, “all
precautions as to her construction and her stowage
will be unavailing.” While public opinion had been
abundantly directed to these precautions, they considered
that other sources of danger had been altogether
unnoticed, and they showed, from a summary
of official inquiries, that from the year 1856 to 1872,
inclusive, while only 60 ships were known to have
been lost from defects in the vessels or their stowage,
no less than 711 were lost from neglect and bad
navigation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their reports.</div>

<p>As these returns<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> too clearly showed, that by far
the largest proportion of losses and other casualties
were due to preventible causes, other than faulty
construction, insufficient repair, or overloading, the
Commissioners directed their attention to a rigid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</span>examination of these causes and to the most effectual
means of finding a remedy for the evil. With regard
to the vexed question of a fixed load-line, which Mr.
Plimsoll had recommended as a means of lessening,
if not of removing altogether, the losses occasioned by
overloading, they were unable to recommend any
enactment for establishing a fixed line, founded on
the proportion of freeboard to the depth of the hold
of the vessel, remarking that the information they
had obtained led “to the conclusion that the settlement
of a load-line should be mainly guided by the
consideration of the reserved buoyancy, that is to say,
of the proportion which the capacity of the water-tight
and solidly constructed part of the ship which
is above water bears to the capacity of the part
immersed.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Load-line.</div>

<p>Analysing various schemes prepared for their consideration,
they remarked that the rough rule of
three inches of freeboard to every foot of hold,
hitherto considered as the measure of safety, while
practically convenient, was not adapted for regulating
the loading of all vessels, and, consequently, could not
be recommended as a law to be enforced. The model
of the ship, the character of her cargo, the method in
which it is stowed, the nature and length of the
proposed voyage, and the season of the year when
engaged, were all matters requiring consideration,
and which it would be quite impossible to embrace
by any fixed rule applicable to every ship, whatever
might be her form or the nature of her employment.
Indeed, they remark with great force, “These circumstances
must continually vary, and, under a charter,
this mode of marking would have the dangerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span>
tendency of inducing the charterer to insist on the
vessels being laden up to the line of deepest immersion,
and thus imperilling the safety of the ship;
while the suggestion, from various instances, that
there should be an elasticity in the law to be left to
the discretion of the surveyor only shows the inexpediency
of legislating either to secure freeboard in
proportion to the depth of hold, or to provide some
fixed percentage of spare buoyancy in every description
of vessel.”</p>

<p>Under all these circumstances, the Commission
considered it desirable to leave the discretion as to
the proper loading of his ship to the Shipowner himself,
holding him responsible, as the law has ever
done, for sending his ship to sea in an unseaworthy
condition, instead of lessening his responsibility by
transferring a duty, which properly rests on himself,
to any official surveyor. But to render the responsibility
of the Shipowner more complete, they recommended
that a vertical scale of feet should be
marked on each side of the vessel, and that, immediately
before the time of her leaving or starting on
her voyage, this measure should be entered in her
log-book and should, wherever practicable, be left
with the officer of Customs or with the British
Consul, by whom the draught of water should also
be recorded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deck-loads.</div>

<p>Having offered a few suggestions with regard to
deck loads and other matters of minor importance,
the Commissioners next investigated with great care
the practicability of instituting a survey of all British
merchant ships. In their opinion, the policy of having
a Government survey for the purpose of securing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span>
the seaworthiness of ships was more than questionable.
Any such measure, while tending to remove
responsibility from those on whom it ought to rest,
would render Government nominally responsible for
the form, the materials, and the whole construction
of our merchant ships, and, consequently, could not
be seriously entertained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Government
survey.</div>

<p>As there is now an official survey of emigrant and
passenger ships, a few witnesses proposed that a
similar survey should be extended to all merchant
vessels. Others went so far as to recommend that
the Board of Trade, already overburdened with work,
should also superintend the construction, the periodical
inspection, the repair, and the loading of the vessels.
But the Commissioners very properly repudiated all
such recommendations.</p>

<p>There are great complaints, the Commissioners
remark, against the interference of Government,
whose surveyors are now not unfrequently accused
of forcing on Shipowners and marine engineers
special views of their own which are not always in
accordance with the best judgment of the two professions,
and that to extend the power of such men would
produce “mischievous consequences to the future
progress of shipbuilding, and would be actually
calamitous.” “Ships,” they add, “would be built
and repaired so as to pass the examination of the
official surveyor, and any additional outlay beyond
what was indispensable to secure a certificate would
be rejected as useless. Under the present enactments,
Shipowners justly complain that their business
is seriously inconvenienced, and that foreign ships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</span>
are already gaining the trade which the British
Shipowners are being compelled to relinquish.”<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Its extension
undesirable.</div>

<p>By the Merchant Shipping Act of 1873 (36 &amp; 37
Vict. cap. 85), the Board of Trade are empowered,
at their discretion, to detain any British vessel
“which they have reason to believe is by the defective
condition of her hull, equipment, or machinery,
or by reason of overloading or improper
loading, unfit to proceed to sea without serious
danger to human life.” By this Act, power is also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</span>given to the Board of Trade to detain any ship for
the purpose of survey, to impose conditions as to
her repair, and to enforce alterations in loading.
The Commissioners do not consider it necessary or
desirable to extend these already stringent and
arbitrary powers, in order to prevent unseaworthy
vessels from leaving any port in the United Kingdom.
On the contrary, they suggest certain modifications
of those powers, so as to make <i>their action more
prompt than it is at present</i>, in which all differences
must be referred to the Board of Trade in the case
of detention, the owner having power of appeal in
England to any court having Admiralty jurisdiction,
and in Scotland to the Sheriffs’ Court; they further
recommend that the master or owner of the vessel
thus detained may be permitted to appeal to the
shipping master or collector of customs, who should
be vested with authority, when necessary, to appoint
two or more competent shipmasters, to constitute a
court whose decision should be final.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> They at
the same time express the hope, that, when these
modifications are adopted, “the detention of vessels
notoriously overladen or otherwise unseaworthy will
gradually compel negligent Shipowners to be more
attentive or to abandon the trade; worthless ships
will be broken up, and the eventual weeding out of
such ships will not only add to the safety of a seafaring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</span>
life, but will be a benefit to the careful Shipowner,
who will find his business increase, while the premium
to be paid for insurance will be reduced.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shipowners
already
harassed
by over-legislation.</div>

<p>Parliament having, for many years, been engaged
in attempting to regulate minute details about
shipping, it is not surprising that Shipowners should
have complained of being harassed in their business
by well-intended but ill-contrived legislation, and that
they should, when further legislation of this sort was
injudiciously proposed, have resisted it to the utmost
of their power. Indeed, the Board of Trade itself
had, for some time, seen the absurdity as well as the
danger of a public department, imperfectly acquainted
with the science of shipbuilding and with the interests
of the commercial marine, attempting to
dictate to shipbuilders and owners of vast experience
the best mode of conducting their business; and, in
the evidence before the Commission, Mr. Gray, Assistant-Secretary
Marine Department, admitted that
many enactments designed to secure safety of life at
sea had been mischievous, and ought to be modified
or repealed.</p>

<p>For instance, the obligation by the Merchant
Shipping Act of 1844 to carry a certain number of
boats in proportion to a ship’s tonnage, was found to
be impracticable, and, consequently, the Board of
Trade, by the amended Act of 1873, took upon itself
a discretionary power in this matter. But discretionary
powers in this case, as in many other instances,
did not work well in practice; surveyors differed in
their views as to the number of boats necessary, and
the number of boats sanctioned at one port was frequently
disallowed at another. Similar objections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</span>
arose in the case of lights, and, as no coloured
lamps could be found on trial until very recently,
equal to the requirements of the Statute, Shipowners
were subjected to similar capricious decisions of
surveyors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mode of
inquiry
into losses
at sea</div>

<p>It would weary my readers were I to enter into
all these details, such as bulkheads, sea-cocks, hatchways,
stoke-holes, compasses, safety valves, and
innumerable other matters which Government has
attempted to regulate by Act of Parliament, as I
have, already, in more than one instance, alluded to
these matters during the course of this work. But
I must not omit directing attention to the large
amount of evidence received regarding the system
of inquiring into losses and casualties at sea, and
to the powers given to the Board of Trade, by the
Act of 1854, to institute such inquiries. It would
appear from this evidence that the officers of the
Board of Trade and the solicitors who act for it,
as well as the Shipowners, have all a serious objection
to the present mode of conducting such
inquiries, and that the tribunal constituted by the
Act does not command general confidence, while
the mode of procedure is dilatory and expensive
(perhaps, necessarily so, where much evidence has
to be collected), and the power of the court is so
ill-defined that, in too many cases, it cannot be
enforced.</p>

<p>The inquiry frequently assumes the shape of a
criminal proceeding against the captain, rather than
of a careful investigation into the cause of disaster,
the chief point at issue being whether the captain is
to be acquitted, or punished by having his certificate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span>
cancelled or suspended; and, inasmuch as he is on
his trial, he may if he pleases volunteer a statement,
but cannot be examined. Nor has the court any
power over the Shipowner, who, however culpable,
is altogether beyond its jurisdiction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">examined
and condemned.</div>

<p>The Commissioners recommended that these inquiries,
made purely in the public interest with a
view to the preservation of human life, should be
conducted in such a manner as would best disclose
the nature and cause of the disaster, whether, for
instance, this was owing to the faulty construction of
the vessel, to bad stowage, to circumstances connected
with the navigation, to the incompetency of
officers, or to the neglect and misconduct of the
master or crew.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recommendations.</div>

<p>With this object in view, they recommended that
the preliminary inquiry now made by the receiver of
wrecks should be limited in the first place to such a
narrative statement as would enable the Board of
Trade, with the aid of their legal advisers, to decide
on the propriety of an official inquiry, and that, if
such were found necessary, there should be a complete
severance between that inquiry and any proceedings
of a penal character, power being reserved to the
Board of Trade to prosecute the Shipowner or to
proceed criminally against the master, mate, or any
member of the crew whose neglect of duty may have
occasioned the disaster. They further suggest that
the 11th Section of the Merchant Shipping Act,
1871, “should be amended and be made expressly to
extend to the master of the vessel; for it is very
important to avoid any doubt that the master who,
without justifiable excuse, leaves port with his vessel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</span>
in an unseaworthy condition, renders himself amenable
to the criminal law.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>The Commissioners very properly attached great
importance to these inquiries, as affording the best
means of ascertaining on whom the culpability rests;
hence, they, incidentally, remark that, in comparing
the accidents occurring at sea with those taking place
on land, especially on railways, they were struck by
the fact that, whereas, in the latter case, it is usual to
prosecute those servants whose negligence has occasioned
loss of life, there was scarcely a single instance
of the prosecution of a master or mate, or of a man
on the look-out or at the helm of a vessel, although
cases have, undoubtedly, been numerous in which
vessels have been lost either by the negligence of
the master or of the crew.</p>

<p>They further recommend that the present system
under which the certificate of a master or other
officer is suspended, very frequently only for an error
of judgment, should be entirely discontinued, and
that neither the Court of Inquiry nor the Board of
Trade should have the power of dealing with such
certificates; but that, in cases to be provided for by
express enactment, the tribunal alone before which
the officer is tried should have the power of cancelling
either all his certificates, or, at its discretion,
his higher certificates, leaving him in these cases the
chance of finding employment in a lower grade.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Examination
of
masters
and mates,
shipping
offices, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., approved.</div>

<p>The examination of masters and mates, the regulation
of space for crews, the insertion of the scale of
food in the articles, the means of remitting wages,
the allotment note, the establishment of seamen’s
savings-banks, and various other important measures,
all indicating as they do the earnest wish of
the Legislature to secure the welfare of the sailor,
received the most careful consideration by the Commissioners,
with a view to their amendment where
necessary. But, though some Shipowners were of
opinion that the system did not work well, and that
they should be allowed to engage seamen, as other
employers engage their workmen, without the presence
of a shipping master, the Commissioners were
of opinion that the shipping offices had been of great
value and ought to be maintained, tersely remarking
that if the captain of a merchant ship would take
trouble to seek out eligible men he could arrange
to meet them at the shipping offices, indeed, could
engage them on board or elsewhere under a special
application.</p>

<p>The anxiety of Parliament to protect the seaman
and, more especially, to treat him as incompetent to
take care of himself, and as requiring the special
interference of the Legislature, had exercised a prejudicial
influence on his character, tending to destroy,
as it did, the confidence which should ever exist
between the master and his crew, and had frequently
promoted insubordination at a time when good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</span>
discipline was most essential to the safety of the
vessel and all on board; moreover, the rule requiring
misconduct on the part of a seaman to be entered in
the log and immediately read to the offender was a
contrivance so ill-calculated to promote good behaviour
that masters frequently left offences unnoticed
rather than resort to such a proceeding; the
Commissioners recommended, therefore, that this plan
should be materially modified (they do not state how),
and that, to secure fair treatment for the seaman,
without destroying discipline or weakening the
authority of the master, should be the object of the
Legislature.</p>

<p>Indeed, when it is considered that the safety of a
merchant ship, as well as of the lives of the passengers
and crew, are entrusted to the skill and judgment
of the master, it is essential that his authority
should be upheld, as any interference tending to
impair his authority and to lower his position adds
seriously to the dangers of navigation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Power of
masters.</div>

<p>As a ship at sea is in herself a little kingdom, the
power of the master should be paramount and all
but unquestioned; hence, while held strictly amenable
to the law for any acts of tyranny and cruelty, the
Legislature was bound to take care not to deprive
him of the control necessary for the security of his
vessel. Now, as the law as it at present stands, gives
him very little power of punishing a sailor for anything
but mutinous conduct, and as the sailor may be
guilty with virtual impunity of many gross derelictions
of duty, such as drunkenness, sleeping on the
look-out, disobedience, and insubordination, the Commissioners
recommend that some remedies, less cumbrous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</span>
than those now existing, should be applied and
more direct penalties inflicted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scheme
for training
boys
for the
sea.</div>

<p>As most of my readers are aware, a system of
compulsory apprenticeship was established in the
year 1844, but was abolished by the repeal of the
Navigation Laws in 1849, and, though some Shipowners,
subsequently, desired to restore this system,
the Government could not, with any regard to principle,
meet their views. The object of training boys
for the sea service having been to secure a supply of
seamen for the Royal Navy as well as for the Merchant
Service, it would have been unjust to compel
Shipowners to train boys for the public service after
they had been deprived of the special privileges,
supposed to be advantageous, conferred on them by
the Navigation Laws. But, as an impression prevailed
that our seamen had deteriorated, both in
number and quality, since the Compulsory Apprenticeship
Act was abolished—though I think this is to
be attributed to other and different causes—the Commissioners
suggested a scheme to meet the existing
evil. They proposed that every vessel above 100 tons
register, whether propelled by sail or steam, should be
required to carry a certain number of apprentices in
proportion to her tonnage, or to pay a small contribution
annually (such as 6<i>d.</i> per ton), to be applied
towards the maintenance of training ships in all the
principal ports in the kingdom. They recommended
that the apprentices should be indentured at or about
the age of fourteen to the master of the training ship
for five years; that, after serving in this ship for one
or two years, the indenture should be transferred to
any Shipowner who would be willing to take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span>
apprentice, and with whom the apprentice might be
willing to serve, until the completion of his term,
and that these school ships should be inspected and
receive grants from the State according to their
efficiency.</p>

<p>No doubt the system of apprenticeship affords the
best means of training boys for a service in which
fitness can only be acquired during early life. But
the success of the system of training boys for the
Royal Navy, recommended by the Commission on
Manning the Navy in 1859 (of which I had the
honour to be a member) is so far questionable that I
think some other mode of obtaining the requisite
supply of seamen for the navy might have been
adopted which would have been more efficacious and
much <i>less expensive</i>.</p>

<p>For instance, “a self-supporting pension fund for
the benefit of seamen, as suggested by the Manning
Commission of 1859 might,” they said, “prove of
great value in creating a tie to bind the British
seaman to the Merchant Service of his own country,”<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
and would, I venture to suggest, if properly organised
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</span>have been a more effective mode of training and
maintaining the requisite number of seamen for the
Royal Navy as well as the Merchant Service. The
Commissioners were also of opinion that, though not
strictly within the scope of their inquiry, a self-supporting
pension fund “well deserved the attention
of Government.”<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>The desertion of seamen in foreign ports was a
matter which, in the opinion of the Commissioners,
“deserved the serious attention of the Government,
inasmuch as British ships are now often obliged to
sail on their return voyage, when heavily laden,
with insufficient or incompetent crews,” and they
recommended entering into arrangements with foreign
governments for some international conventions
which should have for their object the prevention of
desertion and the enforcement of better discipline in
our ships when abroad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marine Insurance.</div>

<p>The question also of marine insurance was one
which received most careful consideration. The
Commissioners felt that while the system protects
Shipowners against losses which would otherwise be
ruinous, it tends to render them less careful in the
management of their ships, and they were, evidently,
alive to the fact that it relieved the Shipowner
from all loss, when his ship foundered at sea,
and frequently enabled him to derive a pecuniary
profit from shipwreck. But to this difficult and
important question I shall fully refer hereafter, as
also to the system of advance notes inquired into
by the Commission.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Report, as
a whole,
most
valuable.</div>

<p>Considered as a whole the Report of the Commissioners
is one of the ablest documents I have
ever examined, and, from the mass of valuable evidence
they have taken, and the care with which it
has been analysed, most of their recommendations
are eminently qualified to effect the great object in
view—to reduce to the lowest possible extent the
loss of life and property at sea.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_239" href="#FNanchor_239" class="label">[239]</a> In 1816, according to the official returns, the merchant navy of the
United Kingdom amounted to 2,783,933 tons; and in 1835 to 2,783,761
tons, or a fraction less; but we know that, at the former period, there
were a great many more vessels on the Register than there actually
existed, from the fact that no means were then taken to ascertain the
losses, or to erase from the records vessels which were lost.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_240" href="#FNanchor_240" class="label">[240]</a> The entries and clearances of British vessels engaged in the
Foreign trade during the years 1816-18 averaged annually 21,735
vessels, of 3,180,472 tons; while for the three years previous to 1836
they averaged 27,390 vessels, of 4,628,450 tons, and, on the accuracy of
these returns at both periods, we can depend.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_241" href="#FNanchor_241" class="label">[241]</a> “Imperfect charts” were often then made to cover, as I fear may be
the case to some extent now, incompetency, drunkenness, or carelessness.
Indeed, about that period, they frequently served as excuses when
other objects were in view. I remember a ludicrous instance of this.
When a boy at school in Ayr I used to accompany my uncle to “the
meeting of owners” of the brig <i>Eclipse</i>, in which he held some eight or
ten 64th-shares. Every spring, the owners met on board to discuss
matters relating to her affairs, and to dispose of what I recollect best,
a round of salt beef, sea-biscuits, and rum-and-water. The <i>Eclipse</i> had
hitherto been invariably employed during the summer season in the
conveyance of timber from some one or other of the ports of New
Brunswick to Ayr. On one occasion, a tempting freight had been
offered for her to proceed to Quebec, and the owners, in conclave
assembled, had all but unanimously decided to send her to that port.
While, however, the discussion was going on, her skipper, Garratt,
or “old Garratty,” as he was called, seemed very uneasy, and gulping
down an extra tumbler of rum-and-water, he at last said,—“Weel,
gentlemen, should you send the <i>Eclipse</i> to Quebec I’ll not be answerable
for her safety.” “How so?” asked one of the owners. “Ah,”
said Garratty, drawing his breath, “<i>the charts are a’ wrang in the
St. Lawrence</i>. Yee’l ne’er see the <i>Eclipse</i> again gin ye send her to
Quebec.” The skipper carried the day.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that Shipowners, when they leave their
captains to provide their own charts (instead of supplying them), do
not stipulate that they are to be the best and the <i>latest</i>. I remember
a ship and cargo (numerous other instances could be produced),
valued at 70,000<i>l.</i>, lost near Boulogne from the master mistaking the
two lights at Etaples for the South Foreland lights; and this, as
appeared by the Board of Trade inquiry, because his Channel chart,
which was thirty years old, had not the Etaples lights marked on it.
Indeed, it so far appears that the large passenger steamer <i>Deutschland</i>,
whose loss at the present moment (30th December, 1875) is now in
course of investigation, was steered by an old chart.</p>

the iron, and, thereby, its elasticity, even though most of this stretch
would probably be due to the links fitting closer into each other, and the
actual stretch of the iron itself only a small portion of the whole.
But in either case the elasticity of the fibre would most likely be injured,
perhaps destroyed.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_261" href="#FNanchor_261" class="label">[261]</a> I believe that there is much justice in these complaints. Indeed,
it cannot be otherwise if official surveyors are honest and vigilant.
For instance, some new danger or evil arises, and some new remedy is
invented. Consequently, the surveyor says:—“I must provide for
this,” and he makes the requirement; the trade call for uniformity, and
the specific thing required becomes a general <i>stereotyped</i> Board of
Trade rule, checking further improvement, and making shipbuilders
build down to it.</p>

<p>On this point, my old friend, Mr. Alfred Holt, of Liverpool—and
there is no one more competent to offer an opinion on such a subject—in
a letter I had from him the other day, remarks with great force:—“The
real objection to Government survey is this: no Government can
insist on more than average standard of efficiency; but most of those
ships of which the nation is proud are built to <i>a much higher standard</i>.
Now, suppose two ships competing for freight, one of the high class I
describe, and one of low type just sufficient to pass survey. Both
have got certificates; these have blunted the discrimination of underwriters,
so that premiums are alike on both, and, naturally enough,
shippers send their goods by the one that asks least freight. Is it
in human nature that the conscience of the good Shipowner will
remain tender? He sees a vessel of much less strength, and not nigh
so efficiently manned, go to sea, perhaps a foot deeper than his, earning
the same rate of freight, and carrying a Government certificate of
competency. Is he likely to keep up to his old standard? and won’t he
be <i>compulsorily degraded</i> to the other’s level? All these surveys only
help the bad, while they injure the good. I may say of ground tackle
that, although since the Act passed, it has become difficult to get any
very bad, it is equally difficult to get any really good. I believe, in my
own case, that the cables I have got since the Act came into operation
are worse than those I got before.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_262" href="#FNanchor_262" class="label">[262]</a> The recommendation might have been advantageously extended to
any other properly constituted tribunal, as it is most desirable that all
such disputes should be promptly settled, and especially in the port
where they arise, or its immediate locality. An appeal in all cases to
the central Board in London might inflict unnecessary hardship upon
the shipowner, and lead to other mischievous consequences.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_263" href="#FNanchor_263" class="label">[263]</a> Although the present system, which originated with Lloyd’s, stands
much in need of reform, I think the recommendations of the Commissioners
on this subject require still further consideration before they
are adopted.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_264" href="#FNanchor_264" class="label">[264]</a> The latter portion of this recommendation also requires further
consideration. While a second trial would be a double expense, it
would not facilitate getting evidence on the first inquest because the
captain would still be able to say,—“I shall not give evidence which
may be used against me.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_265" href="#FNanchor_265" class="label">[265]</a> There is no use hiding a fact which my experience on this Commission
and elsewhere has too clearly revealed. It is this, that the
officers of the Navy as a rule (there are exceptions) are much less
inclined to the amalgamation, under any circumstances, of the seamen
of the merchant service with those of the Royal Navy than the officers
of the Army are to coalesce with the Volunteers. They desire, and it
may be due to their patriotism, to have a large standing navy, as
large in peace as in war if they could get it; while they do not care
to be troubled with the drilling of relays of seamen from the merchant
service when they can obtain young men expressly trained,
solely at the expense of the State. They do not, or will not, understand
the vast natural resources this country has within itself—far greater
than any other countries,—or, indeed, than nearly all other countries
combined, available in the hour of need.</p>

calm and impartial spirit. So many exaggerated
statements have been recently made, in and out of
Parliament, with reference to the extent of the loss
of life caused by men being sent to sea in “coffin
ships,”<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> as if such occurrences had no existence except
in our own time, and were the creation of a prevailing
eagerness to be rich too soon, that it is, above
all things, necessary to adhere strictly to facts, in
considering further legislation, should such be necessary,
and to regulate any measures to be enforced on
this subject by such facts alone. Nothing can be
more dangerous than legislation founded on sentimental
or sensational reports.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Coffin
ships.”</div>

<div class="sidenote">Great improvement
of our
ships and

recent
years.</div>

<p>But if “coffin ships” still exist, and I fear they do,
this cannot arise from lack of legislative enactments.
Indeed, the wisdom of Parliament has, for the last
quarter of a century, been seriously directed every
Session to the improvement of our ships and of their
crews.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Nor have individual efforts of the most
effective and laudable description been wanting to
prevent the construction of vessels of an unseaworthy
character:<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> while it is <i>not</i> the case, as has been
alleged, that, either our ships or the officers by whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</span>
they are navigated have deteriorated. On the contrary,
they have, within the last quarter of a century,
vastly improved in almost every respect. If any of
my readers have any doubts on this question, let
them refer to the answers to Mr. Murray’s circular
of 1843,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and to those sent by our consuls abroad to
Mr. J. G. Shaw Lefevre’s circular of 1872.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> It may
be that our seamen do not “hand, reef, and steer,”
with the same alacrity as they did in the days of our
forefathers, simply because such duties are less required
now than they were then; but our masters
and mates are infinitely superior to what they were
a short time since, and in our regular lines of steamers
and packet-ships, there are to be found a class of
seamen much more sober and steady than could be
found in any merchant service twenty-five years ago.
Men now exist, who are quite as competent for the
duties required of them, as any seamen of the days of
Duncan or Nelson, and far more to be depended on
for the performance of their duties on board of merchant
ships than was the case in my own boyhood,
although there are, still, far too many who are inefficient,
drunken, and worthless. There are likewise
still many ships lost which ought not to be lost, but
the assertions which have been made with regard to
an increase in the amount of loss during recent years
have been greatly exaggerated, as I shall now endeavour
to show.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duties of
the Board
of Trade
with regard
to
wrecks.</div>

<p>Among the multifarious duties imposed on the
Board of Trade, not the least important is that
connected with wrecks, casualties, and collisions
of ships at home and abroad. For many years, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</span>sort of record had been kept of those casualties,
but it is not until 1855, when the duty devolved
on the Board of Trade, that we have any reliable
statistics.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Of course the number of wrecks, casualties, and
collisions reported for any one year, increases or
diminishes according to the prevalence or absence of
gales of remarkable violence and duration. These
sometimes tell in an appalling manner, in the greatly
increased loss of life which occurs in one year over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</span>another. A Table,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> copied from the wreck returns
of the Board of Trade of 1874, classifies the reports
so far as regards the loss of life, showing how far
one year has been more disastrous than another;
for instance, in 1859-60, the number of lives lost
was five times greater than in the previous year,
and three times more than in the year following,
arising, in a great measure, from the disastrous gale
in October 1859 in which 343 lives were lost in
the <i>Royal Charter</i>, wrecked on the Anglesea Coast.
Again, in 1867-68, nearly double the number of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</span>lives were lost than during any year either before or
since: in fact, no less than 326 vessels were lost or
damaged, and 319 lives sacrificed by tempest, between
the 1st and 3rd December inclusive of the former year.</p>

<p>But, though between 1855 and 1873, 13,466 lives
were lost on the coasts of the United Kingdom, more
than 71,000 lives were saved,<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> during the same period,
from the shipwrecked vessels; and, though the duty
of a seafaring man is proverbially a dangerous one,
and the navigation of our coasts is attended with
greater perils than those in any other parts of the
world, it is astonishing how small is the percentage
of loss either of life or property, when compared with
the amount of shipping frequenting our shores.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wreck
chart; but
the extent
of loss not
sufficiently
examined.</div>

<p>In the <a href="#i-022sm">frontispiece</a> to this volume will be found a
wreck chart of the British Islands, prepared from
the last Board of Trade Returns for the year
1873-4. A red dot signifies a case of total loss; a
blue dot signifies a case of partial damage. The first
glance of this chart is very appalling; but it becomes
less so when we consider the enormous number
of vessels annually frequenting our coasts. Many
hundreds of vessels at times leave the northern coal
ports, alone, in one day; and I estimate that, in the
year to which this chart refers, no less than 500,000
vessels of 90,000,000 tons! including their repeated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</span>voyages, frequented the coasts of Great Britain and
Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>But, however startling these figures as a measure
of the immense number of vessels frequenting our
coasts, they affect the mind much less than a glance
at the actual facts, the fleets themselves. Until I
made a course from the Thames to the Tyne, and saw
the sea covered with ships, steamers, and fishing
boats, of all kinds and sizes, and saw what an industry
even the fishing alone employed, I never had clearly
in my own mind a notion of what our mercantile
marine really was. Let anyone survey from the fort
of Tynemouth and ancient churchyard adjoining—a
favourite walk of mine when I represented that
borough in Parliament—and see from 200 to 300
ships going out at one tide, or watch the passing ships
from Flamborough Head or from the cliffs of Dover,
or let him steam through the endless crowd of herring
boats off the Scotch coast, and he will have a stronger
impression of the magnitude of the mercantile marine
of Great Britain than can be derived from the
most careful study of all our Blue Books on the subject.</p>

<p>In dealing with this question, it becomes our duty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</span>to consider carefully such realities as these. We
should not be led astray by a mere glance at the
wrecks and casualties which appear on the face of
the chart—a chart which has too frequently been
used as a picture to alarm the public mind, and
induce people, <i>who will not take the trouble to inquire
for themselves</i>, to believe that the question of the loss
of life and property at sea has not received that
consideration from Government or Parliament which
its great importance demands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Danger of
too much
Government
interference.</div>

<p>I have frequently remarked, in the course of this
work, that, however great our exertions have been to
save human life, more might still be done, but, without
all the facts, further legislation, based on general
impressions, and still more so on popular clamour
(valuable in itself, though but too often deplorable
in its results), will prove of the most mischievous
character. We must, also, remember that every act
fettering free navigation, renders our Shipowners
less able to compete with those of other countries, and,
if it does not forward the main object in view—the
safety of life—must be a clear national loss, because
it renders us less able to make our ships a source of
profit, a result which, if not carefully watched, might
easily be carried to such an extent as to discourage
investments in British shipping.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</span></p>
<p>Now if we take the total disasters on our coasts,
including trivial accidents, it does not amount to
anything like one-half per cent. per annum, and to
not three out of every thousand of the vessels frequenting
these shores; indeed, when we consider the
dangerous character of these shores, the rocks and
shoals with which they are surrounded, the storms
with which we are visited, the frequency and uncertainty
of these storms, and the dense fogs which often
prevail, we may, so far from being startled by the
sight of the wreck chart, be surprised that the
casualties are not far greater. But, to arrive at the
true bearing of the case, it is desirable to analyse
the disasters. Besides the red and blue dots on the
chart, indicative of total loss or partial damage to
vessels, I have indicated by similar dots, with a cross
above, the number of disasters in the course of the
year, which were attended with <i>loss of life</i>. When
my readers examine these, they will be still more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</span>
agreeably surprised. From the Frith of Forth to
Spurnhead, a distance of somewhere about 150 miles
of the most rugged, unprotected, and dangerous
coast in the world, where numerous fleets of vessels
are constantly wending their way, and in every
description of weather, there were only seven vessels
wrecked with loss of life during 1873-4, and two
of these were partial losses. In calling attention to
this fact, I must remind my readers that, on the
part of our coast in question, the most inferior description
of vessels, and the most deeply laden, carry
on their hazardous trade. If we next cast our eye
over the line of coast extending from London to the
Lizard Point, and embracing the whole coast of the
English Channel, a distance of somewhere about 400
miles, we will see that during the whole of the
same year there were only fifteen wrecks with loss
of life, and seven of these were partial. Nor is the
proportion greater on any other portion of the coasts
of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loss of life
in proportion
to
vessels
afloat.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of
loss.</div>

<p>But we should do well to inquire still further, and
not merely compare the present number of disasters
with those of former years, but likewise their extent
and character; and, as far as is practicable, the different
causes of loss, so as to endeavour to apply, to
the best advantage, any further remedies that may
be necessary. I have shown<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> that the average loss
of life during the three years ending 1835 was 894
per annum, when we owned 2,780,000 tons of shipping;
but the loss of life for the year 1873-4, when
our Merchant Shipping had increased to 7,294,230
tons, of which no less than 1,825,738 tons consisted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</span>of steamers, in which the risk of navigating our
coasts is greatly increased, amounted only to 506,
of whom 103 were lost in foreign vessels. Many of
the remaining 403 were lost on fishing boats, and
other vessels not registered under the Merchant
Shipping Act.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Very material progress towards the
saving of life on our coasts has, therefore, been made
during the last forty years—a progress which will
appear the more striking when I direct attention to
the fact, that, while the entrances and clearances of
British ships engaged in the foreign trade were, in
1835, not much more than 4,000,000 tons, they had
increased to more than 26,000,000 tons in 1873-4.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
Of the 506 lives lost, 61 were lost in vessels that
foundered; 76 through vessels in collision; 200 in
vessels that stranded or were cast ashore derelict;
and 101 in missing vessels. The remaining 68 lives
were lost from various causes, such as by being
washed overboard and by other accidents on board.
The whole of the above lives were lost in 130 vessels,
87 of which were laden, and 40 in ballast. It is not
known whether the remaining three were laden or
light.</p>

<p>If we take the last five years from 1869 to 1873-4
inclusive, we find the total number of wrecks and
casualties of vessels of every kind, arising from all
causes and including collisions, amounted to 8952,
giving an annual average of 1791; the average loss
of life in these vessels during the five and a half
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</span>years, including the disastrous half-year 1873, being
755 per annum. Although no return is kept in
minute detail of the approximate cause of these
disasters, we learn from the wreck register, that in
the year 1873-4, 381 were from collisions, and 1422
from wrecks and casualties other than collisions;
346 were wrecks, &amp;c., resulting in total loss; and
1076 partial damage more or less serious. Of the
total losses, 128 happened when the wind was at
“force 9 or upwards” (a strong gale), and they are
classed as having been caused by stress of weather;
93 from inattention, carelessness, or neglect; 30
from defects in the ship or equipments (and of these
thirty, 19 appear to have foundered from unseaworthiness);
the remainder seem to have arisen from
various other causes. Of the 1070 casualties, 525
arose from stress of weather; 180 from carelessness;
and 91 from defects in equipments; and the remainder
from various other causes. In 1873-4, there
were, on or near the coasts of the United Kingdom,
165 wrecks and casualties to smacks and other fishing
vessels, which are included in the above returns,
and in these, 76 lives were lost, while 195 lives were
lost in vessels of the collier class.</p>

<div class="sidenote">More details
required.</div>

<p>These returns are, no doubt, very valuable as far
as they go, and have become more so since they
were extended to the loss of <i>all</i> British ships, and,
where practicable, to the cause of the loss. But
the class of the vessel, whether built of wood or
iron, and the draught of water when she left her
last port, might be added to advantage. Nor
should we omit the familiar S.S. to distinguish steam
from sailing ships. However, they amply show that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</span>
no charge can be justly made against either the
Government or the Legislature of any dereliction
of duty in their endeavours to save the life of all
persons who “go down to the sea in ships.” Nor
can we charge the people of this country with any
callousness or want of sympathy for the seafaring
portion of the population. The number of Acts of
Parliament passed in recent years, and the grants
of public money voted for the purpose of saving
life, are an answer to all such charges; while noble
private institutions, like the Shipwrecked Mariners’
Society, the Lifeboat Establishments, the Royal Alfred
Asylum, besides various other charitable associations
for the benefit of seamen, testify in this respect to
the liberality of the public.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Improvement
in
lighthouses,
buoys, and
beacons.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Harbours
of Refuge.</div>

<p>Nor have the lights, beacons, and buoys on our
coast, all tending materially, as they do, to save life,
been neglected. On the contrary, while we have
greatly reduced the charges, we have increased the
number and highly improved the quality of our lights.
By the Act passed in 1836,<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> a number of lighthouses,
which formed part of the hereditary estate of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</span>
Crown and had been allowed to get into the hands
of private persons, were transferred to the Trinity
House, provision being made for reducing the exorbitant
tolls previously levied. By an Act of 1853,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
the expenditure of the Trinity House on lighthouses,
and that of the Scotch and Irish lighthouse
boards, was subjected to the control of the Board of
Trade, and, since then, the reduction on the charges
for lights, buoys, beacons, &amp;c., has been fully 75 per
cent. Nor has the question of Harbours of Refuge
been overlooked; for, besides the construction of
various national harbours, large sums of public
money have been advanced at a low rate of interest
for the improvement of local harbours, expressly for
the benefit of merchant ships and seamen, and these,
while facilitating commerce, have, in no small degree,
tended to the safety of life and property.</p>

<p>Indeed, so anxious has Government been to
rectify any shortcomings in legislation, which might
tend to the loss of life, or inflict a hardship on seamen,
that the Bill of Mr. Fortescue (now Lord Carlingford),
passed in 1873,<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> contained not merely clauses
about “load-lines” and “clear sides,” but a provision
giving seamen a claim for compensation when, having
been detained on a charge of desertion, the ship, upon
survey, was shown to be unseaworthy. This Act
further contains a provision, strengthening the power
of the Board of Trade to detain unseaworthy ships,
whereby that “Board are enabled to act of their own
accord, and without complaint from without,” the
result of which has been that, up to the last return,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</span>out of the 474 vessels detained and surveyed by the
Board of Trade under this Act, 435 have been on the
report of their own officers, and 39 only on complaints
made <i>ab extra</i>.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> To these facts I may add, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</span>having a very important bearing on the opinions I
have hitherto ventured to express, that only 24 out
of the 474 vessels were detained <i>because</i> they were
overladen; and that, out of these, not a single vessel
detained was alleged to be overladen on information
given by the crews, notwithstanding the encouragement
they had to become informers against their
employers. This power to detain is extended to
cases of overloading and improper stowage or imperfect
loading, and the conditional orders of release
are of a very elaborate character, while the provisions
concerning payment of expenses, and the mode of
appeal, are made far more full and explicit.</p>

<p>This Act further gives power to vary the requirements
contained in the Merchant Shipping Act of
1854 with regard to boats—requirements, I may add,
which it had been found practically impossible to
comply with. It likewise contains a clause, which
ought to have been the law long since, making it
criminal (though the dictates of humanity, it had
been thought, were in themselves sufficient), in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</span>
master, after collision with another vessel, not to stand
by and render assistance. In the same statute, a code of
signals of distress has been adopted and very properly
enforced, as well as a general code of pilot signals.</p>

<p>Many losses having occurred from spontaneous
combustion of coal on board ship, Government, in
1874, appointed, on the recommendation of Lloyd’s
Committee, a Royal Commission, under the chairmanship
of Mr. Childers, to inquire into this subject,
but this Commission has not yet concluded its labours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extraordinary
scene in
the House
of Commons
on
the withdrawal
of
the Merchant
Shipping
Bill, 1875.</div>

<p>Early in the Session of 1875, the Government
introduced another Merchant Shipping Bill, containing
various amendments of the then existing
law, and among them a special clause which had for
its object the abolition of all advance notes. This
Bill met with very considerable opposition (partly of
a frivolous character), rendering its progress through
the House so slow, that Government found it desirable
to withdraw it, more especially as the Bill had
been materially altered and curtailed in the course of
various divisions, especially in the clauses referring
to the advance notes and other matters of importance.</p>

<p>When Government intimated its intention of
withdrawing the Bill of which they could no longer
approve, and which they had not time to pass, a
scene arose<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> happily of rare occurrence in the debates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</span>of the British Parliament. It was closed, however,
with great dignity by the Prime Minister and leader<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</span>
of the Commons. He had introduced such a measure
as he no doubt, after grave consultation with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</span>
Cabinet, considered necessary and sufficient. The
House, and more especially those members of it
who were more immediately interested in maritime
affairs, and who either approved or opposed the views
of Mr. Plimsoll had so mutilated the Government measure,
that Mr. Disraeli would no longer be responsible
for it. To use his own words, he “declined to deal
with the subject in that fragmentary manner,” and no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</span>
man of prudence or common sense can blame him for
the course he adopted under these circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Another
Bill introduced
by
Government.</div>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the popular outcry was
so great against the course he had adopted, aroused
as this had been for the moment by the well-meaning
but rhapsodical protests of Mr. Plimsoll, backed, as
they no doubt were, by many really benevolent men,
that Mr. Disraeli, in the end, considered it expedient
to introduce another Bill, embodying a portion of his
own views together with those of the philanthropists.
Although this Act contains some necessary and
useful provisions, it is not a wise measure, nor can
the Government have considered it perfect, as it was
hurriedly passed so late in the Session as the 6th of
September, and is only to remain in force until the
1st of October 1876.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Its conditions.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Unusual
personal
power
granted to
Surveyors.</div>

<p>This Act confirms the powers previously given to
persons, specially appointed by the Board of Trade,
to detain what they consider unseaworthy ships,
<i>without previous orders from the Board</i>, an addition
which, however necessary, ought not to have been
conceded to any individuals without much further
consideration and discussion than it received. This
addition opens the door to corruption in its most
pernicious and dangerous forms, by giving, as it does,
to each one of a great number of subordinate officers,
<i>personal</i> authority to detain “unseaworthy vessels,”
thus transferring to a single person a power the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</span>Board of Trade alone possessed under the Act of
1873, and laying down a principle contrary to all
good government, while relieving that Board of its
administrative responsibility. Otherwise the Bill contains
some useful provisions, and none more so than
where it prohibits the carriage of a cargo of which
more than one-third consists of grain, &amp;c., unless
the grain is secured from shifting by suitable boards
or otherwise. But, while this clause may be necessary
or right in itself, its meaning may be misconstrued,
and it may lead to further and more detailed
legislation, making its vague language specific, and
calling on Government officers in <i>Foreign</i> ports to
enforce its provisions.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>The Act also amends the clause in the Act of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</span>
1871, which makes the sending an unseaworthy ship
to sea a misdemeanour, by providing—</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) That criminal liability shall attach to any
one who attempts, or is party to an attempt, to send
such a ship to sea, and to a master who knowingly
takes such a ship to sea.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) That every ship shall have a registered
managing owner, and that if she is sent to sea from
any port in the United Kingdom in an unseaworthy
state he shall be liable, unless he proves that he has
done all he can to prevent it.</p>

<p>The Act further provides that every British ship
shall be marked permanently with lines on her sides
showing the position of her decks.</p>

<p>It also provides that the owner of every foreign-going
British ship shall, before clearance outwards
from any port in the United Kingdom, mark upon
her sides a maximum load-line, and shall insert the
distance between this and the deck marks in the entry
outwards at the Custom House and in the agreement
with the crew.</p>

<p>The Act further stipulates that every contract
with a seaman shall imply an obligation on the part
of the owner and his agents to use all reasonable
efforts to make and <i>keep</i><a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> the ship seaworthy. The
effect of this clause is to give the seaman or his
family a remedy against the owner. But it does not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</span>extend to damage or loss of life caused by the act of
a fellow seaman other than the master.</p>

<p>Happily it is not necessary, in reviewing the recent
changes in our Mercantile Marine Laws, to notice
those personal matters which have unfortunately
been raised in the course of their discussion, except
to express regret that Mr. Plimsoll in dealing with
a subject of such great public importance should
have made grave assertions and charges alike against
Government and private individuals, too many of
which he has not merely entirely failed to prove,
but has neglected to withdraw.</p>

<p>Had Government been persistently neglectful of
its duty in its endeavours to mitigate the loss of life
and property at sea, there might have been an excuse
for some of these charges, especially if it had neglected
necessary legislative enactments.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> But such
has not been the case. On the contrary, Parliament
of late years, while producing some excellent
measures, has interfered far too much with the details
of the affairs of individuals connected with Merchant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</span>Shipping: and, though yielding for the moment to a
popular cry, Mr. Disraeli may well have had reasonable
doubts whether further legislation might not, so
far from lessening, tend to increase those dangers and
disasters which must ever attend the navigation of
the ocean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Propriety
or not, of
further
legislation
considered.</div>

<p>Having, however, officially announced his intention
to review the whole subject, and to consider it in all
its bearings, I venture to invite the attention of my
readers to the more important points now pending.
They are: a compulsory load-line, and the production
of an official certificate of seaworthiness by all ships
before they are cleared at the Custom House.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compulsory
load-line.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. J. W.
A. Harper’s
evidence.</div>

<p>So far as regards the proposed compulsory load-line,
a very competent and intelligent witness who
gave his evidence before the Royal Commission on
unseaworthy ships, says,<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> “I think nothing could be
more serviceable and nothing more excellent than
to obtain and, if it were possible, enforce a load-line;
but I also think there is nothing more impossible.
A load-line, do what you may, is the opinion of an
expert. How can you, by authority, enforce the
opinion of an expert? I have had before me,” he
continues, “a great many proposals for ascertaining
load-lines for ships. Some of them are very ingenious.
By the best of them you may get, with
considerable accuracy, the cubical displacement of the
empty ship, the displacement of the cargo, and so
you may arrive at the cubical space left in the ship
available for floating. And getting that you get a
valuable and useful fact for some objects. <i>But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</span>
supreme difficulty remains untouched, viz., What ought
the floating capacity to be?</i> I cannot imagine it
possible to enforce by any Government intervention
a rule <i>which must depend in every individual case upon
the opinion of an expert</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. W. J.
Lamport
and others.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Opinion of
the Commissioners.</div>

<p>Such, also, was the purport of the evidence of the
great majority, if not of all the witnesses examined
before the Commission; but I quote that of Mr.
Harper, because he is not merely thoroughly competent
to offer an opinion on the subject, but is
altogether disinterested. Indeed, from the appointment
he holds, it would be to his interest to recommend
a compulsory load-line, and he would no doubt
have done so, had he not thought that any such
legislative measure would be likely to aggravate the
evils sought to be remedied. In fact, the whole tenor
of the evidence is that a fixed load-line would do
more harm than good.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> And such was the opinion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</span>of the Commissioners, who state, “that any rule of
freeboard founded on surplus buoyancy gives to a
vessel of light scantling an advantage over a stronger
vessel. Thus the inferior ship would by law be
allowed to carry the heavier cargo. Such an enactment
would not contribute to the safety of life at
sea. From all the evidence we have collected on
this subject, we are of opinion that an Act of Parliament
enforcing any scale of freeboard would be
<i>mischievous</i>.”... “A law presenting such a rule
would therefore <i>enhance the perils of a seafaring life</i>.”</p>

<p>Nor can impartial persons who have studied this
question arrive at any other conclusion, for as the
Commissioners justly add, “There is no general agreement
as to a rule by which the requisite amount of
<i>reserve</i> buoyancy could be determined, and it appears
that, except under definite circumstances, it is not a
determinable problem. The proper load-line in each
particular case depends not only upon the principal
dimensions of the ship, but also upon her form and
structural strength, the nature of her cargo, the
voyage, and the season of the year.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voluntary
load-line.</div>

<p>The Commissioners, consequently, limited their
recommendation so far as regards freeboard to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</span>
extent that “every merchant ship should have
marked upon each of her sides amidships, a vertical
scale of feet downwards from the edge of her main-deck,”
and that a note of her draught of water
“should be entered in the log after the vessel has
received her full load, immediately before the time of
her starting on her voyage, which should, wherever
practicable, be left with the officer of Customs or with
the British Consul, by whom it should be recorded.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its value
questionable.</div>

<p>This recommendation was proposed to be carried
out in the Government Bill which was withdrawn,
but, in the Act now temporarily in force, the provisions
are somewhat different. The advantages of
either system are problematical. Shipowners will
continue, as they have hitherto done, to load their
vessels to such draught as they consider prudent,
and if one of their vessels is lost, and other persons
remark that she was too heavily laden, the answer
will either be that the draught was as usual, or that
safety in proportion to depth is a matter of opinion
depending on many varying circumstances. The
mere fact of publicly recording the draught of water
would, it is to be feared, have little effect on unprincipled
or avaricious Shipowners, against whom alone
the law is aimed. Practically, I think the system of
marking now in force will be of little or no avail,
and that the result will not be as the framers of the
law intended. A Shipowner being now required by
law to mark upon the sides of the vessel amidships
a circular disc 12 inches in diameter, to be so placed
that “the centre of the disc shall indicate the <i>maximum</i>
load-line in salt water to which the owner
intends to load the ship for that voyage,” will perceive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</span>
that to place the disc only slightly above the
usual line of load draught would, on the one hand,
fetter him to some extent; while, on the other hand,
he would incur no disadvantage by placing it so much
higher as to ensure its being well clear of the water
under any circumstances of loading. A maximum
load-line will, therefore, in practice mean the line
down to which the ship will certainly <i>not</i> be loaded.
Indeed, from the information I have gained on the
subject, the practice with some Shipowners seems
already to be that the discs are placed one, two, and
in some cases, three and even four feet above the water-line.
The mere marking it would, therefore, appear
in a great measure worthless, as surveyors will still
require to wait until a ship has her cargo on board and
is ready for sea, before they can form any opinion as to
her safety. Whether it is wise, on the part of Shipowners,
to place the disc so far above the vessel’s
ordinary water-line as to make it meaningless has been
doubted by many, but the fact remains that it is so
placed in very many instances. It would, certainly,
have been better to have omitted from the clause of
the Act I have just quoted the word “maximum,” as
few Shipowners would have placed their discs too
high if, by doing so, this indicated an intention on
their part to overload their vessels.</p>

<p>However, if it can be shown that this new mode
of marking the sides of a ship tends in any degree
towards the greater safety of life and property at sea,
the shipping community, generally, will not complain
of the expense and trouble. In all good governments
there is a pervading principle to which all classes
submit, that the interests of the few must be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</span>
subservient to the good of the many, and that, especially
where life is at stake, no reasonable trouble or
expense should be spared to preserve it. But if, on
the other hand, it is found that this system of marking
or registering the draught of water is useless,
or even injurious, Shipowners will have great cause
of complaint against Government for an unnecessary
interference with their business, provided they can
show that they have made an earnest endeavour to
apply the provisions of the Act fairly and in the
spirit in which they were framed.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>The other important point on which Mr. Plimsoll
insisted is of a different character. But to carry it out
in the way suggested, or as it was argued in the
House of Commons and before the Royal Commission,
would be impracticable, and even if practicable, it
would be most mischievous: the Commissioners in
their Report state the question as follows:—“With
the view of providing for the greater safety of life at
sea, it has been suggested that the Board of Trade
shall superintend the construction, the periodical inspection,
the repair, and the loading of all British
Merchant Ships.” Considering the extent of our
mercantile marine and the mode in which business
must, necessarily, be conducted if we desire to maintain
our present high position as a maritime nation, any
such suggestion is simply absurd and, if carried into
effect, would be most ruinous. That we have already
too much legislation in matters of detail the Commissioners
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</span>themselves admit. Referring to the pernicious
effects of inquiry into such matters by Government
surveyors on Emigrant ships, they say,
and from the evidence before them they would have
been justified in expressing their opinion in still
stronger terms, “We consider it to be a question
worthy of serious consideration, whether, in the case
of passenger ships, the certificate of the Board of
Trade, so far as regards specific approval, should not
be expressly confined to the number of passengers
to be allowed, and to the accommodation for their
health, comfort, and general security; all questions
of unseaworthiness of hull, machinery, and equipment
being left to the owners, subject only to a
general power of interference in case of danger, sufficiently
apparent to justify special intervention.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">How this
can be
accomplished.</div>

<p>I have been unable to ascertain who made the
extraordinary proposal, that every ship from the
time her keel was laid until she was loaded and
ready for sea should be under the superintendence of
officers appointed by the Board of Trade. In justice
to Mr. Plimsoll I must state that, though I have read
his book, and nearly all his speeches, I cannot trace
any recommendation that the merchant ships of this
country should be placed, either as regards construction,
inspection, or repair, altogether, under the
control of the Board of Trade or of any other
Government department.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> What Mr. Plimsoll mentions
seems to me, to be a matter to which I have
often referred in the course of this work, that we do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</span>not utilise to anything like the extent we might the
vast private resources within ourselves, and that we
might do so to advantage, so far as regards <i>the
survey of our merchant ships</i>, not one of which he
suggests should be allowed to go to sea unless she is
<i>seaworthy</i>. Now this is a suggestion which few men
would be bold enough to decline to consider, and Mr.
Plimsoll points out how this may be secured by means
already at our disposal. Perhaps in the way he
puts it, the difficulties with which it is surrounded
could not be overcome; but the maxim cannot be
ignored, as it is sound in principle.</p>

<p>To leave the survey of our ships to any one private
institution, not on a sufficiently broad basis, such as
Lloyd’s Register, might create as many evils as a
general Government survey, and, besides creating
jealousy on the part of other somewhat similar institutions
or associations, might be considered contrary
to the rules of sound government. But these institutions
could be enrolled and licensed, as various other
associations now are, and empowered to grant certificates
of seaworthiness, which every ship above a
certain tonnage would require to produce before she
was cleared at the Custom House. Or they might
be welded into one great national institution directly
controlled by all the various branches of the shipping
community in harmony with their sentiments, and
alive to the wants and necessities always arising
through the growth and development of trade and
commerce.</p>

<p>Individuals may do wrong, and, though it may be
for their interests to have a good sound ship, there is
no denying the fact that ships are sent to sea which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</span>
are not seaworthy; but corporations and associations
cannot do wrong with the same impunity. If they
did, they would be deprived of their licence, and
there would be a check, one against the other, which
is not the case with individuals. Or, on the other
hand, a great representative institution would be
efficiently checked and influenced by public opinion,
and the voice of those immediately concerned. Were
Government to require these associations to <i>classify</i>
ships, then I agree with the Commissioners, that it is
not its province “to ascertain whether a ship is fit
for the conveyance of dry and perishable goods,” but,
from the debates in Parliament, and numerous
articles in the public press, it is clear that many
persons are of opinion, that it is the duty of Government
to be reasonably satisfied that a ship is <i>seaworthy</i>
before she proceeds to sea. We exercise this duty
in the case of railways, mines, and manufactures of
various kinds, and events have shown, however much
we may have already done to save life and property at
sea, that the exercise of a similar duty, if practicable,
is at least worthy of consideration in the case of ships.</p>

<p>As the great bulk of the vessels belonging to
the United Kingdom are already classed, the certificate
of classification they now hold would suffice
as a certificate of seaworthiness. Those which are
not now classed in Lloyd’s Register, or in any other
association, but which belong to the great steam
companies, or to very large shipowners, are so well
known for their good qualities as not to require
classification, and for this reason classification, or, at
least, survey for seaworthiness, even if compulsory,
could not be a serious hardship to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</span></p>

<p>Practically the number of vessels now unclassed is
confined to the very good or to the very bad ships.
With the owners of the former I should think there
would be no difficulty in dealing; they do not class
their ships either because they do not care to incur
the expense (underwriters being ready to insure them
at the lowest current premiums), or because they
think they can construct ships, in their own way,
superior to those which are built to rules for classification.
But such men, while they might protest,
and justly so, against being interfered with in a
business they more thoroughly understand than any
government or private surveyor, and in which they
take a laudable pride (for such men are the pillars
of our maritime greatness), would, I doubt not, have
no objection to an authorised surveyor inspecting
their ships, and would readily pay the moderate fee
required to cover the cost of a certificate of <i>seaworthiness</i>.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</span></p>
<p>For the information of the general public I may
state that there is a very great difference between the
highest grades of vessels and those which any surveyor
who knew anything about his business would
pronounce to be <i>unseaworthy</i>. In the case of classed
ships, the certificate of classification would suffice; but,
from the owners of ships who do not class, many
intelligent persons are of opinion that a certificate
of <i>seaworthiness</i> should be required. They argue, and
with great force, that those persons who do not class
their ships, because they will not bear inspection,
have no right to imperil the lives of others for their
own gain. Life is not a thing of price; if it were, the
rich would live, and the poor would die. And when
a Shipowner declines to bear the expense of making
his vessel seaworthy, he places in jeopardy the life of
the sailor to benefit himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Registration
Associations.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Lloyd’s
Register,
its great
importance.</div>

<p>There are very easy means of ascertaining the
seaworthiness of a ship, <i>when first sent afloat</i>, already
at our disposal, as those of my readers, who are not
conversant with this subject, will find by referring to
the Appendix,<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> where a history of Lloyd’s Register
of British and Foreign Shipping will be found. That
association has a well-organised and extensive staff of
surveyors, through whom, at a very small cost, this
fact could be ascertained. My readers will also there
see the immense advantage that association has
afforded in the improvement of our ships and the
power it possesses of rendering still greater public
service. But while rivalry amongst associations for
classification is unquestionably injurious,<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> it may not
be considered advisable that Lloyd’s Register alone
should issue certificates of seaworthiness. There are
other similar associations whose certificates would
answer the object in view equally well, and it is for
Government to decide (should an attempt be made to
carry this principle into practice) what associations
shall be empowered to issue the requisite certificates.</p>

<p>But while I cannot ignore the principle that no
unseaworthy vessel should be allowed to leave our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</span>ports, I cannot hide from myself the fact that there
would be numerous difficulties (but far from insurmountable)
in the way of carrying it fully into practice.
It might be argued that if the Board of Trade
enrolled the associations named, and, more especially,
if it took them under its <i>immediate</i> control, they
would in a few years, instead of being private Institutions,
be mere servants of the Board, and, through
the Board, of a sensational House of Commons. But
that argument may be met by the Shipowners saying
to the Board of Trade, “We do not wish to be under
your immediate control at all. Why should we not
be allowed to manage our own affairs, as all other
branches of the community now do,—subject, in our
case, as in that of all others, to such enactments only
as may be necessary for the public safety? We ought
to know our own business a great deal better than
any of your surveyors can teach us; and, if we think
proper to form ourselves into an association, or associations,
to manage our own affairs, and if we do
what the country requires, why should we be interfered
with by the Government as to the manner in
which we think proper to build, equip, and navigate
our ships, any more than other traders in the
management of their affairs? Enrol us, if we think
proper to associate, as you do joint-stock concerns or
other associations; let us form a board with members
elected by the persons interested, such, for
instance, as the Metropolitan Board of Works, to
manage our own concerns, with specific rules for the
protection of the public, which, if we violate, you
will punish us as you would do any other class of
the community.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</span></p>

<p>Now, arguments such as these are really unanswerable.
Statesmen and others, who have to
encounter the harassing difficulties of official life, and
who know that all executive power <i>must</i> be exercised
by a minister, or by individuals responsible to him,
and, through him, to the public, might say, “How are
we, unless all ships are under our immediate control,
to meet questions put to us in the House of Commons,
such as, ‘Whether such and such a society
licensed by Government had the folly and audacity
to allow of spring safety-valves, or of boats not fitted
with Clifford’s Patent?’ or how could we justify a
licence granted to an association which showed such
flagrant disregard of modern inventions and of
seamen’s lives?” But the reply to all this is that
it is <i>not the province of Government to legislate on such
details as these</i>, any more than it would be to dictate
by Act of Parliament, how the details of any other
branch of trade or manufacture are to be carried out.
The duties of Government have long since been defined,
and it is because Government, of recent years,
has gone far beyond its duties in the case of Shipowners,
that Shipowners complain, and justly complain,
against Government for a “meddling and
muddling” in matters alike beyond its province and
its knowledge.</p>

<p>Reverting to the principle which so many persons
now say should be enforced by legislative enactment,
the seaworthiness of every ship, there would be great
difficulty in carrying that out <i>by Government</i>, as
seaworthiness is not definable. That is to say,
though a vessel may be seaworthy, when launched,
(even then it would depend upon the trade in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</span>
she was to be employed), she might not be so at the
end of her first voyage, or she might be so for one
trade in summer, but not in winter, or with one description
of cargo, but not with another; or, in fact,
with the same cargo if properly stowed,<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> but not
otherwise, and so forth. The details are so numerous
that it would be impossible to enter upon them within
my limits, and for the same reasons, if the principle
is to be carried out, it can only be by the association
of competent individuals with the necessary staff
under their control, possessing that knowledge
which long experience alone can give. I mention
these points in case the Legislature consider it necessary
to enforce this principle; for, if it is to be
carried out, it should be in such a manner as will
satisfy the public with the least possible interference
with the duties of the Shipowner.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Improvement
of
seamen by
better education.</div>

<p>In the meantime I must direct the attention of my
readers to the unseaworthiness of too many of our
seamen, which is of really greater national importance
than the unseaworthiness of our ships.
However desirable it may be to make certain, if we
can, that no unseaworthy ships shall leave our ports,
the incompetency, carelessness, and drunkenness of
seamen demand much more seriously our attention;
and, as all legislative enactments have hitherto failed
to raise them to the requisite standard, we ought to
direct our attention more earnestly than we have yet
done to their <i>education</i>. If education is necessary
on shore, it is still more so with seamen, and yet
we have done, practically, nothing, as a Nation, to
assist them in gaining knowledge, and, especially,
that description of knowledge required in their
calling. Indeed, we have not seriously attempted
any great practical scheme for their education or
for the amalgamation of the services of the Royal
Navy and those of the mercantile marine, which,
while invaluable to us as a nation, would tend so
much to elevate the social position of that neglected
portion of their class, who, not having the
good fortune to be enrolled in the Navy or on the
lists of the large Shipowners, must seek their daily
bread at sea in any ship where employment can be
found.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evil effects
of advance
notes</div>

<p>On the contrary, we have, in some respects, pandered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</span>
to their pernicious habits. For instance, when
a clause in the first Government Bill of last Session
(1875) was introduced to render advance notes
illegal, the House of Commons rejected it. From
my own experience I can have no hesitation in
stating that the system of advance notes (I do not
include the <i>allotment notes</i>, which are most useful)
tends to lower the character of seamen, promotes intemperance
and insubordination, and has been the indirect
means of far more disasters at sea than either
overladen or otherwise unseaworthy vessels.</p>

<p>Besides, any such system is unknown to any other
class of the community. What should we think of a
mechanic or house servant who could not enter our service
unless we paid him a month’s wages in advance?
We should have nothing to say to him—1st, because
we should not care to trust our money to a person
who, on some frivolous excuse, might decline to repay
us by his faithful service; and (2ndly) because we
should, naturally, consider anyone requiring such
an advance an improvident if not a worthless person.
These advances must, necessarily, discourage
frugality and prudence; while, in the case of seamen,
they most assuredly lead, directly, to intemperance
and vice. Nor is there any real occasion for making
advances in their case. The mechanic or the house
servant may have been for some time out of employment,
and, as his wages are paid weekly or monthly,
he may not have laid by anything; but, in the case
of seamen, their wages are paid at the end of the
voyage, often in large sums, and by means of savings-banks
and money-order offices, specially established
for their use, they have every facility afforded them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</span>
for retaining their earnings. But they do not.
Why? Because the Legislature has encouraged
their natural and <i>proverbially</i> improvident habits,
by acknowledging a system of advance of wages
unknown to any other class of workmen, on which
advance they depend for an outfit, after too frequently
squandering the wages they had earned on
a previous voyage.</p>

<p>But I should prefer my readers considering carefully
the Report of the Commissioners on this subject
instead of my own views, and therefore I do not
hesitate to give these conclusions at length,<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> as a
large mass of evidence was brought before them.
They, as statesmen and philanthropists, had no
object in view beyond the national good, and,
more especially, the welfare of the seafaring population.</p>

<div class="sidenote">confirmed
by the
opinion of
the Commissioners.</div>

<p>“The evidence before us leads to the conclusion
that the system of advance notes is one great obstacle
to the amelioration of the condition of merchant
seamen. All the witnesses whom we have examined
admit that the system is most pernicious, but it is
defended on the ground that, without this advance,
the sailor could not pay for his lodging on shore, or
procure the clothes requisite for him when he joins a
ship.</p>

<p>“In practice it seems that the advance note is
handed over to the lodging-house keeper, not usually
in exchange for cash, but in discharge of debts which
the sailor has been induced to incur. The lodging-house
keeper charges a heavy discount, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</span>
sailor is frequently brought on board half-clad and
intoxicated.</p>

<p>“Shipowners and captains of merchant ships concur
in stating that a large portion of the ship’s crew
is very often brought or even lifted on board in a
condition of helpless drunkenness, that the vessel
must often be detained for twenty-four hours in order
that the men may be so far recovered as to be able to
get her under weigh, and that there is great risk of
life and property at the commencement of the voyage
from the consequent inefficiency of the seamen.</p>

<p>“The advance note is not payable until some days
after the sailing of the ship; but if the ship then
puts back or touches at another port, the seaman often
takes the opportunity of making some complaint, in
order to get free from his engagement, and will even
incur a month’s imprisonment with this object, whilst
the Shipowner or the person who has cashed the note
loses the money which has been paid in advance.</p>

<p>“It is said that if there were no advance note, the
crimp in a foreign or colonial port would not have
the same inducement to entice the sailor to desert.</p>

<p>“After careful consideration of the numerous evils
attending this mode of prepayment, we recommend
that advance notes should be declared illegal, that no
payment or order for payment made in advance for
wages shall be a discharge for the payment of any
portion of a seaman’s wages when due, and that no
money paid by a Shipowner to or for a seaman shall
be debited to the seaman, except wages already earned,
the allotment notes, and the cost of such supplies as
the seamen may receive after joining the ship.</p>

<p>“There will be some inconvenience felt at first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</span>
from the abolition of the existing system of advance
notes, and there will be perhaps considerable opposition
to the change in the ports, and amongst the
lodging-house keepers, who profit by these notes.
We feel, however, convinced that unless this mischievous
mode of payment be discontinued, the
seamen will never be raised from their servile dependence
on crimps, and taught to rely on their own
industry and intelligence.”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Over-insurance.</div>

<p>But there is a question of quite as great importance
to which I shall again have occasion to refer when I
review the history of our steam companies, and show
the remarkably small amount of loss that some of
them have sustained through the system and order
prevailing on board their vessels. <i>There we shall see
how losses are prevented.</i> In the meantime, we should
do well to inquire how losses are encouraged by
allowing policies of insurance to be effected for a
greater amount than the value of the ship or the
cargo she contains.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Views of
Mr. T. H.
Farrer.</div>

<p>A contract of marine insurance is in its essence a
contract of indemnity, and the spirit of the contract
is violated if the assured can make the occurrence
of a loss the means of gain. But the law has allowed
a very considerable deviation from this fundamental
principle. Mr. T. H. Farrer, in his evidence, happily
illustrates this in the case of a ship with a chartered
freight, bound from London to Calcutta and back.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
He supposes her to be lost on her outward passage
in the Bay of Biscay. Presuming that the owner
only insured her prudently and not exorbitantly, he
would recover in this case not merely the value of
the ship at the commencement of the voyage, but also
the freight of the outward and homeward voyages,
while he would be exempted from paying the seamen’s
wages from the date of the disaster, the expenses
necessary to carry his ship to Calcutta, to remain
there, and to return on her homeward passage, so that
he would be, actually, a very considerable gainer by
the loss.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Nor is the matter less flagrant in the case
of valued policies, when the value of the property is
fixed by agreement beforehand between the assured
and the underwriter. The effect of this, as the Commissioners
justly remark,<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> is, “that unless the policy
is altogether void, on account of fraud, or the concealment
of a material fact, the assured can, in the
case of a total loss, receive the value which has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</span>stated in the policy, however much it may exceed
the actual worth of his property.” In confirmation
of their opinion, they add “that, in certain decided
cases, the Shipowner has been allowed to recover 50
and even 100 per cent. more than the actual value of
his vessel.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
of other
witnesses.</div>

<p>Various witnesses recommended that, in case of a
total loss, the underwriter should be allowed to question
a valued policy, when he considered that the
value had been overstated; but many Shipowners
and underwriters objected to this proposal, contending
that, where a value had been agreed on between
the Shipowners and underwriter, subsequent interference
would be mischievous or futile, as it might
induce Shipowners to insure abroad. It was contended
that the value of a ship might depend on a
variety of circumstances; for instance, the loss of a
steamer to a Shipowner, about to start a new line of
steam communication, would be inadequately replaced
by the cost of the vessel, though estimated values of
this sort are very problematical.</p>

<p>As regards insurance of freight, it was further
suggested that the Shipowner should not, in case of
total loss, be entitled to recover his freight, without
deducting the expense saved to him by reason of the
loss of the vessel. On the other hand, it was alleged
that the necessity of estimating these uninsured expenses
would give rise to doubt, difficulty, and litigation,
and that, if the suggestion were adopted, the
Shipowner would be to a great extent deprived of
the legitimate advantage he now enjoys of being able
to obtain with facility an advance on his freight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinion
of the
Commissioners.</div>

<p>After carefully considering all these matters, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</span>
Commissioners arrived at the conclusion that they
ought not to recommend any alteration of the law
with regard to valued policies in cases of total loss,
as there were weighty reasons against any interference
on the part of the Legislature with contracts
made by persons capable of taking care of their own
interests, without carefully ascertaining the effect
this interference was likely to produce on the entire
system of law relating to such contracts. But they
were of opinion that the “whole system of insurance
law requires complete revision, for not only does it
allow the assured, in some cases, to recover more than
the amount of the loss actually sustained by him, but
it also, on the other hand, deprives him of an indemnity
in cases in which he ought to be protected by
his insurance.”</p>

<p>The Commissioners, however, with great force,
remark, that “a complete and thorough revision of our
laws relating to marine insurance is a task of equal
importance, difficulty, and delicacy, requiring evidence
of an extensive character, and necessitating a
very lengthy and careful investigation, and it touches
directly on so many subjects unconnected with
the security of life at sea, on which it has only an
indirect and somewhat remote bearing, that we do
not think it properly falls within the scope of our
commission. We should also have been reluctant to
undertake the complete revision of our system of
marine insurance law, because, for many reasons, it
appears to us to be important that, before such a task
is undertaken, an attempt should be made to induce
foreign nations to concur with us in framing and
adopting a general code of insurance law. To alter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</span>
the English law of marine insurance to any considerable
extent, might have the effect of throwing the
business of insurance into the hands of foreigners,
and there is so much insurance of foreign property in
England, as well as of English property abroad, that
it is most desirable that the law of insurance should,
as far as possible, be the same among all commercial
nations. An examination of the foreign codes leads
us to hope that there would be found no insuperable
difficulty in the way of attaining this important
object.”</p>

<p>Although the Commissioners do not at present
recommend any alteration to be made in the law relating
to valued policies, they think that the Shipowner
should not be able to recover his insurance,
whether under a time or voyage policy, in cases
where it is shown that he or his agent had not done
everything reasonably within their power to make
and maintain the ship in a seaworthy condition,
where that unseaworthiness occasioned the loss.
They further consider that the Shipowner’s liability
for damage to property or person should be unlimited
in cases involving the death of the seaman or the
damage to person or property. They are also of
opinion that the present system by which insurance
cases are tried before a judge and jury is altogether
unsatisfactory, as a single judge and two assessors
would constitute a far better tribunal. In conclusion,
they recommend that the Marine Department of
the Board should be revised and strengthened by
having a legal adviser exclusively attached to it (a
recommendation which has been since carried out).
“It will,” they remark, “be the duty of the Board<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</span>
of Trade to check the negligent and to punish the
culpable shipowner, but it is desirable that these
functions should be performed without harassing the
great body of Shipowners, who, by their ability and
indefatigable energy, have contributed to the prosperity
of the empire.”</p>

<p>I have now endeavoured to give as succinct an
account of the whole course of the maritime legislation
of the British Empire and its effects upon
ships, seamen, and commerce as my space will permit,
from the earliest period up to the close of the
year 1875. Although it is not the province of an
historian to enter upon controversial questions, much
less to dive into the future, yet history is of little
value unless we can gain knowledge from the past
which can be made useful hereafter. I may therefore
be permitted to close this volume with a few remarks
on the subject of further maritime legislation,
especially as the subject is one to which an unusual
amount of public attention has been devoted during
the last two or three years, and as it has been, officially,
announced that it will be again dealt with by
Government in the ensuing Session of Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Too much
legislation
already.</div>

<p>Shipowners say that there is far too much legislation
already, and I certainly agree with them; but
when they charge the Government as they do, and
especially the Board of Trade, or rather Mr. T. H.
Farrer, as its permanent Secretary, with forcing all
this over-legislation upon them, I must remind them
of the facts. What Government did, and did wisely
and well, as I have endeavoured to show, was to
frame such mercantile marine laws as had become
essential after the repeal of the Navigation Laws.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</span>
The laws then passed have, unquestionably, been of
great service, not merely to the nation, but to Shipowners
themselves. Having completed all that was
considered necessary, Government directed its attention
to the amendment, as cases for its necessity arose,
and to the consolidation of existing laws; and I can,
of my own knowledge, state that Mr. Farrer has,
since then, opposed all further legislation which had
for its object the interference with the details of a
Shipowner’s duty. But the House of Commons would
not allow Government to rest with its good work.
“Independent members” of that House, actuated by
various motives, some of them not very clearly defined,
commenced to “amend” (?) in their own way,
these laws (see Hansard’s ‘Reports of Parliamentary
Proceedings’), by proposing numerous fresh clauses
and fresh Bills which, if Government had not resisted,
would most likely have doubled the existing
number of the mercantile marine statutes. They
next commenced to introduce Bills of their own, to
teach Shipowners how to construct and equip their
vessels. Among the first of these measures was the
Act to test chains and anchors, introduced by Sir
J. D. H. Elphinstone and the late Mr. John Laird.
So far from that Bill receiving the approval of Government,
when I moved its rejection,<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> was strongly
supported by Mr. Milner Gibson, the then President
of the Board of Trade. We were, however, defeated,
and the Bill passed and became law.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this success, other independent
members followed, and, since then, most of the
measures connected with the mercantile marine of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</span>this country have been forced upon Government
either by Bills introduced by individual members, or
by questions asked, or by deputations from interested
constituencies, or “philanthropists,” who, however
good in their intentions, are, too frequently, mischievously
ignorant of the subjects they force upon
the attention of Parliament. No one of my readers
conversant with these matters can say that the Bills
of the last three or four years, except so far as
necessary amendments, were Government measures.
They were nearly all forced upon the executive,
while the only real and valuable measure of Government,
the consolidation and codification of existing
laws, has been, Session after Session, rejected, or, at
least, “shunted” aside by the House of Commons.</p>

<p>For more than two centuries we attempted to
regulate our maritime commerce by means of the
Navigation Laws and their innumerable additions
and amendments, the fallacy of which I have endeavoured
in these volumes to expose; yet we are
now following the same course our forefathers
adopted by attempting, by means of a library of
Mercantile Marine Laws, to regulate the details
of the business of our Shipowners. Commerce, in all
its branches, flourishes most when left alone. Leave
our Shipowners alone, except when they do wrong.
Leave them to manage their own affairs in such a
manner as they consider most conducive to their
own interests, and we may rest assured that, if they
have a fair and free field and no special favours,
they will maintain, against all nations, the maritime
supremacy of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity
of a Mercantile
Marine
Code,</div>

<p>My advice, therefore, to the House of Commons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</span>
if an old member may venture to give it, would be
to do nothing next Session in the way of fresh legislation,
but to confine itself to necessary amendments,
and to the codification of existing laws, so that Shipowners
may have one law for their guidance; at
present they are bewildered by the numerous fragmentary
laws now in force. But, in addition to
whatever reorganisation and changes may be found
necessary, increased facilities would still seem requisite
for the immediate payment of seamen’s wages
on their discharge; and, though the mode of inquiry
into the causes of the loss of life and property
at sea has already been altered, greater rigour is
still demanded for such inquiries, and more prompt
means of detecting and punishing persons who ignorantly
or negligently lose the vessels in which they
serve. In cases of wilful loss, which I hope and
believe are of rare occurrence, the law cannot be
too prompt, too stringent, nor too severe. A man
who <i>wilfully</i> loses his ship, I rank without hesitation
with the “villain and the murderer.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">and of
more
prompt
punishment
in
criminal
cases.</div>

<p>Nor should I have much more mercy on the Shipowner
who recklessly loses his ship, or who is accessory
to her loss; and I should subject to punishment,
though in a different and more modified form, any
Shipowner who, either ignorantly or negligently,
sends his ship to sea in an unseaworthy state. In
these matters, the law is still open to improvement,
both as regards greater facilities for the discovery
of crime and its prompt punishment, arising, as
this does, in no small degree, from its too complex
character.</p>

<p>Although the Shipowner is now made liable for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</span>
criminal neglect, and cannot, by contract, relieve himself
from this liability, such neglect is difficult of
proof, and a jury deciding against a Shipowner
on a question of damages, may, often, hesitate to
make him criminally responsible. If it were possible
to enforce this liability in all cases where
guilty; if every Shipowner were made to feel
that the proper construction, equipment, loading,
manning, and navigation of his ship were matters
to which it was his duty to attend, and if these duties
were enforced, it would produce much more salutary
effects in the way of saving life and property at sea
than any Government surveys with a legion of inspectors
at their back: each one of these relieves the
Shipowner from a duty which belongs to him alone,
and relieves, or, at the least, might relieve, him from
a part of his responsibility; for if, as in the case of
compulsory pilotage, a Shipowner is relieved from responsibility
in case of accident, he cannot, in common
justice, be held criminally liable when he has acted
in conformity with such laws as have been passed for
his guidance and control.</p>

<p>Whether it would be possible, as has been recommended,
to establish by positive enactment an absolute
and indefeasible obligation on the part of every Shipowner
to his shippers, passengers, and underwriters,
that he and the agents to whom he trusts his ships,
shall do all in their power to make and <i>keep</i> his ship
seaworthy, is a problem I am not, at present, prepared
to solve; moreover, it raises numerous questions of
great difficulty and delicacy.</p>

<p>Some amendments may be, also, required in the
tonnage and measurement law, which, though, as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</span>
have already explained, now a vast improvement on
any previous law, still presents features of hardship
alike on Shipowners and seamen, as, in the case of
the latter, frequent instances occur where the law is
evaded by the stowage of cargo or stores in spaces
appointed by the present Act for the accommodation
of the crew.</p>

<p>Such are the leading measures which may still
require the attention of the Legislature; but, before
closing my remarks, I desire my readers to recollect
the existence of a Merchant Shipping Code, which has
not yet become law. It embraces all the laws relating
to Merchant Shipping, and if the First Minister
would take up this Bill and amend it in detail, he
would not merely confer a boon on the largest
shipping community the world has ever seen, but one
by which his name would be long remembered.</p>

<p>If the Legislature did nothing else during the
ensuing Session, it would be a Session well spent:
ten clear sittings<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> would, however, suffice, if there
was a determination on both sides of the House
to allow no party spirit to interfere. Nor should
any such feeling be displayed, for the questions now
to be considered are almost wholly of an executive
and not of a political character; while all the materials
are now ready, the lengthened inquiries and
discussions to which almost every point except insurance
(and on this there must be further inquiry
before there is any legislation) has been already subjected,
render further discussion, in a great measure,
unnecessary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Concluding
remarks
on
the extraordinary
progress of
British
shipping.</div>

<p>I have endeavoured to show how much progress
has been made during the last quarter of a century—a
progress eminently due to the repeal of our Navigation
Laws and to many of the earlier measures of
the Board of Trade, in confirmation of which I may
point to the magnificent ships now produced, to the
enormous extent of our mercantile fleets,<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> as compared
with those of all other nations, and to the superiority
of our officers to what they were before the repeal of
the Navigation Laws.</p>

<p>There is, nevertheless, a wide and noble field in
which the statesman might employ his power and
genius to great advantage, and earn for himself an
imperishable name. The means are now in a great
measure at his disposal. But he must decide between
two principles. He must not, on the one hand, give
way to the question of sentiment or to the popular
cry that merchant ships and their cargoes shall be
under Government survey, and, at the same time,
hold Shipowners responsible for acts which legislation
has placed beyond their control. If he adopts the
former course, he must double or treble the existing
staff of officials; but I venture to warn him that, in
so doing, he will place a canker-worm at the root of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</span>our maritime greatness, which will as surely destroy
the mighty fabric we have raised by individual genius,
energy, and skill, as ever did the “dry rot” in our
wooden ships of war and commerce.</p>

<p>Seeing what our Shipowners have already accomplished,
he might to advantage afford them facilities
for <i>self-government</i>. The means, as I have shown, are
already at his disposal. We have Lloyd’s Register,
with its large staff of competent surveyors ready
to aid, at our disposal, as also a similar association
in Liverpool. We have mercantile marine boards,
elected by popular constituencies, at all the leading
seaports in the kingdom, under whose supervision
the shipping officers are now placed, as well as the
examination of all masters and mates. Leave them
as they are; but, as I understand that these boards
are not overburdened by the duties now devolving
on them, could not their duties in relation to the
crews be extended and some arrangement be made
whereby these different institutions, formed into one,
two, or more central and district boards, might perform
all the work of detail now required by Parliament?
By some such amalgamation everything the
country requires could be done more economically
and efficiently than at present.</p>

<p>Lloyd’s Registry now tests all anchors and chains
as required by Parliament, without any disturbance
of their functions or the work for which they were
originally constituted, the voluntary classification of
ships. Why should we not place in their hands such
duties connected with the ship herself as the regulation
of load-lines, certification of seaworthiness, if
found expedient, and the supervision of all matters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</span>
of detail which Parliament may consider necessary,
in the construction, equipment, loading, and navigation
of our ships? All these matters would be much
better done by a popularly elected board chosen from
merchant Shipowners and underwriters than by any
Department of the Government. In their hands
might be safely placed the appointment of surveyors:
one Department of this new Board attending to the
hull of the ship, the other to her navigation, as at
present; all these matters being subject, of course, to
such regulations as Parliament might consider it
expedient to impose, and represented in Parliament
by the President of the Board of Trade, or, in lieu
thereof, by a Secretary of State for Commerce, should
that be desirable.</p>

<p>I merely throw out these remarks for consideration,
being aware that many obstacles, though few real
difficulties, would require to be overcome in carrying
out some such re-organisation as I venture to
suggest. But whatever changes Ministers may consider
most expedient to adopt, they must not lightly
tamper with the merchant fleets which the skill and
genius of our people have created, or with the position
they have achieved since relieved from those
legislative enactments, by which they were bound
for more than two centuries. These fleets are now
the largest, and unquestionably the finest, in the
world, and instead of foreigners overstocking our
own ports as was prophesied, we now conduct the
greater portion of the maritime commerce of foreign
nations.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> It is, therefore, no idle boast to say, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</span>while the sun never sets on the dominions of our
Queen, there is no ocean, no sea, and, I might add,
were it not for the exclusive policy of the United
States and of France, with a few other insignificant
exceptions, no lake, no river, where the British flag
is not unfurled, and where it does not shed its civilising
and beneficial influence, over many peoples of
varied tongues, who might otherwise still be living
in darkness, if not in barbarism.</p>

<p>It behoves, therefore, our Statesmen to take care
how they deal with this great interest—made great
by the freedom of our laws and by the energy of
our people; and, whatever further legislation may
be necessary, it is seriously to be hoped that Government
will confine its measures to their legitimate
object; viz. the clear definition of the legal duties
and responsibilities of Shipowners, the maintenance
of lighthouses, buoys and beacons on our coasts, the
general regulations necessary for the proper conduct
of maritime commerce, the investigation into the true
cause of all accidents at sea, and the prompt punishment
of all persons who wrongfully and wilfully
violate the law.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_278" href="#FNanchor_278" class="label">[278]</a> This point involves many grave questions. Happily, men do not
altogether live for the purpose of making money—they have other and
far nobler objects in view. Some, indeed, but they are rare and
grand characters, live altogether for the benefit of mankind and the
progress of the human race. There are others who follow a business
or profession, not altogether because it yields them profit, but because
it affords them pleasure. Such is the case to a large extent in this
country. We are a seafaring people, and we pursue occupations in
connexion with it frequently as much for pleasure as for profit. We
enjoy the business of Shipowners, because it is natural to us, and we
take a delight in improving the forms of our ships. I have seen a
captain whose heart was in his ship, caress her!—yes, caress her, by
clapping the taffrail where he stood when she was performing her
work to his satisfaction, as if she had been a living thing, and heard
him exclaiming, “Go a-head, my beauty!” just as many persons may
have been heard extolling the performance of a favourite horse. Care
must, therefore, be taken not to interfere by <i>unnecessary legislative
enactments</i> with what is not merely our business but our pride and
pleasure, or we may be driven, to the serious loss of the nation, to
seek other investments for our capital. We have now arrived at that
point where competition has become so close that if we tax our Shipowners
to any greater extent than they are now taxed, directly or
indirectly (interference with their affairs is the heaviest as well as the
most obnoxious of all taxes), we shall most assuredly drive their ships
from the trades in which they are now engaged, or compel them to
submit to the humiliation of seeking a Foreign register, and hoisting a
Foreign flag.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_282" href="#FNanchor_282" class="label">[282]</a> As it has often been broadly stated that employment in British
ships is much more dangerous now than it was in 1836, when the first
Committee sat to inquire into the cause of shipwrecks, I may reply that
the most careful analysis shows that, while the losses were then on the
average of the three previous years 3·72 percentage of the number of
vessels (or rather of their tonnage) employed, they were for the three
years previous to 1873 only 2·95 per cent., although these years were
exceptionally fatal to ships laden with timber, grain, and coal (see
Appendix to ‘Commission on Unseaworthy Ships,’ pp. 780 and 791),
arising from the enormous increase in the oversea trade of these articles.
For instance, while in 1861, 57,745,993 cwts. of corn were imported, the
imports in 1872 amounted to 97,765,298 cwts. The imports of timber
rose between the same periods from 3,358,589 to 4,949,786 loads; and
the oversea exports of coals from 7,934,832 in 1861 to 13,198,494 tons
in 1872.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_287" href="#FNanchor_287" class="label">[287]</a> However beneficial in its results, it may well be questioned if any
body of surveyors ought to be empowered at their pleasure, without
complaint, to thus retard trade and stop the ordinary course of commerce;
and I am disposed to question alike the policy and the
wisdom, as well as the necessity, of this regulation. There appear
to be now employed in these questionable operations, no less than
117 Government surveyors, “shipwrights,” and “engineers,” stationed
at different ports in the United Kingdom, twelve of whom are retired
officers of the Royal Navy, besides a good many so-called “shipwrights,”
who can have very little knowledge of the construction of merchant
ships or of their requirements.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> In making these appointments, the
fact seems to have been overlooked that, at all our ports, there are the
surveyors of Lloyd’s Register, or of other similar associations, whose
services might have been utilised with a great saving of public expenditure,
and with, perhaps, greater efficiency. Yet I read, to my
astonishment, in the public journals not long since a letter (6th
August, 1875) from Mr. Plimsoll, addressed to the President of the
Board of Trade, in which, among much irrelevant matter, he urgently
recommends eighteen more surveyors to be appointed by Government,
at a salary of not less than 1000<i>l.</i> per annum. I sincerely trust no such
appointments will be made; but that Government will direct its
attention to other more economical and more efficient modes of removing
the evils of which Mr. Plimsoll complains, if indeed they exist at all to
the extent alleged. There is no use hiding the fact that all such
appointments must be filled, in a great measure, through patronage,
and that it would be impossible to find men, even at the tempting
salary named, competent for the numerous technical and responsible
duties that would be required of them. But if such men could be
found, are we to hand over the whole of the vast maritime interests of
this country, from the time the keel is laid to the despatch of the ship
to sea, to the supervision and control of a certain number of Government
officials, however competent? As it is, the duties of the surveyors,
already appointed, are too frequently as ludicrous as they are questionable.
I daresay Mr. Plimsoll must have felt this when he recommended
in his letter to Sir Charles Adderley, that “we ought not to have less
than four detaining officers in Ireland, four in Scotland, and ten in
England, and that the <i>minimum average(?)</i> salary should be 1000<i>l.</i>
per annum.” Of course he meant them to look after the officers already
appointed as well as after the ships; and that they should be “apart
altogether from the Permanent Secretary, and the Secretary of the
Marine Department,” whom he charges, in the same letter, without, by
the way, one tittle or shadow of evidence, with the grossest dereliction
of duty.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_289" href="#FNanchor_289" class="label">[289]</a> I feel no hesitation in giving, from the public journals, an account
of this most extraordinary and unusual scene, not merely as an episode
in the history of Merchant Shipping, but to explain the circumstances
under which the temporary Act now in force was passed at the close
of the Session of 1875:—</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Charley</span> asked the First Lord of the Treasury whether he
could hold out any hopes of being able to afford facilities for the third
reading of the Infanticide Bill in time to enable the House of Lords to
consider it this Session.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Disraeli</span> said he thought he could hold out some hopes to the
hon. member. He felt some difficulty on Monday in stating the intentions
of the Government, but this arose from their desire to pass
the Merchant Shipping Bill this Session; but, finding it impossible to
get through the committee on the Agricultural Holdings Bill this week,
they had come to the conclusion to abandon the Merchant Shipping
Bill. It had been submitted to the Government that they might pass
the Bill in a modified form, but he declined to deal with the subject in
that fragmentary manner. All he could say was that they would take
the earliest opportunity of bringing forward the measure next Session.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Goschen</span>, speaking on behalf of the shipping interest, expressed
his extreme regret that the Merchant Shipping Bill had been sacrificed
for the Agricultural Holdings Bill.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Plimsoll</span> earnestly entreated the Government not to consign
thousands of their fellow-creatures to an undeserved grave. There
were, he said, shipowners of murderous tendencies—(‘Order, order!’)—who
had frustrated the passing of the Bill by protracted debates. The
secretary of Lloyd’s had assured a friend of his that he did not know of
a single ship which had been broken up during the past thirty years
because it was worn out. The result was that hundreds of brave
fellows were sent to unhallowed graves by these speculative scoundrels—(cries
of ‘Order!’ and uproar).</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> informed the hon. member that his remarks were out
of order. When the Merchant Shipping Bill, which was on the orders
of the day, came up for consideration he would have an opportunity of
addressing the House.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Plimsoll</span> said he would give notice that on Tuesday next he
would put a question to the President of the Board of Trade with
reference to certain vessels which had been lost, entailing a great
sacrifice of human life, and would ask whether those vessels were not
owned by Mr. Edward Bates, the member for Plymouth, or a person
bearing the same name. He should also have some questions to put,
with respect to members on the Liberal side of the House, for he was
determined to unmask the villains who sent these people to their death—(cries
of ‘Order!’ and tremendous uproar).</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> said: The hon. member has used the term ‘villains.’
I trust that he did not apply it to any members of this House.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Plimsoll</span>: I did, sir, and I shall not withdraw it.</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: The conduct of the hon. member is altogether unparliamentary,
and I call on him to withdraw the language—(cheers).</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Plimsoll</span> (excitedly): And I must again decline to withdraw
it.</p>

<p>“In reply to a third interrogation by the Speaker, the hon. member
again declined to withdraw.
The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: The hon. member declines to withdraw, and I must
submit his conduct to the judgment of the House.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Plimsoll</span>, standing in the centre of the House, said he would
submit to the judgment of the House. Once more approaching the
table, holding a paper in his hand, said, ‘This, sir, is my protest,’ and
was proceeding to address the House, but in obedience to loud cries of
‘Order!’ he took his seat on the front bench below the gallery.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Disraeli</span> rose and said that the conduct of the hon. member
was almost unparalleled.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Plimsoll</span>, jumping up and interrupting: ‘And so is that of
the Government’—(tremendous uproar).</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Disraeli</span>, continuing, said: I feel that it is my duty, as far as
I can, to uphold the dignity and honour of the House; for the conduct
of the hon. member has been not only violent, but so offensive, that it
is impossible for the House to pass it over. As the hon. member has
declined to withdraw the word used, it is my duty to move that he
be reprimanded by the Speaker for his disorderly and violent conduct—(loud
cheers).</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> said that according to the practice of the House the
hon. member for Derby would answer in his place, and then withdraw.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Plimsoll</span> retired to the bar, and as he reached it, turned round
apparently with the intention of saying something, but the members
there prevailed on him to pass out, and as he did so, he exclaimed:
‘You do not know the men as well as I do. This will cost the lives of
thousands.’ The hon. member then left the House.</p>

<p>“The Marquis of <span class="smcap">Hartington</span> rose and was about to address the
House, but was informed by the Speaker that the motion before
the House was, that the hon. member for Derby be reprimanded.</p>

<p>“The Marquis of <span class="smcap">Hartington</span> said he need hardly state that he
should support the motion—(cheers). It was evident that the hon.
member was labouring under great excitement, but he was not justified
in using the language he had employed. No doubt, when he had a little
time for reflection, he would see his conduct in a different light—(cheers).</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Sullivan</span> said the scene they had witnessed was without precedent
in the House, but he appealed to the House to be indulgent to
the hon. member. He was aware that the hon. member was extremely
ill, and his state of mental excitement arose from his overstrained
feelings. Without seeking to justify the transgression of the hon.
member, he wished the House would allow him to have a week’s rest,
by which time he would be in a position to apologise for his misconduct.
He (Mr. Sullivan) held in his hands the documents which had
wrought the hon. member up to his present state of excitement, and for
some time past his friends had been caused the most serious uneasiness
by the deplorable state of his mind. If the House would afford him a
few days’ rest, he would no doubt be able to set himself right—(cheers).</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Disraeli</span> then moved that the hon. member for Derby be
requested to attend in his place on this day week—(loud cheers).</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Fawcett</span> said that Mr. Plimsoll was at present in an extremely
painful state of excitement. He had gone out to him in the lobby, and
found him in the most lamentable condition. By great effort he had
persuaded him to take a walk in the open air—(great laughter). At
the end of a week there was little doubt that he would withdraw the
violent expressions he had used—(cheers).</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Bass</span>, as the colleague of Mr. Plimsoll, offered his grateful
acknowledgments to the House for the course they had taken—(cheers).</p>

<p>“The matter then dropped.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“On the motion for discharging the Merchant Shipping Bill,</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Bates</span> said that he wished, with the indulgence of the House,
to make a statement with respect to what had fallen from the hon.
member for Derby earlier in the sitting. All who had witnessed the
extraordinary exhibition would agree with him that the hon. member
for Derby was not responsible for his actions. With respect to himself
it was unfortunately true that he had lost during the last two years
five ships; but ships better found in every respect were never sent to
sea. They were all of them iron ships, and classed A 1. To himself,
personally, pecuniarily the loss was very severe, as he never insured his
ships for more than one-half or two-thirds of their market value. That
was not so much the matter; but he did deplore the loss of his men,
and his only consolation was that, as far as human foresight could go,
the ships were as good and as safe as man could make them. He felt
assured that the statement of the hon. member for Derby would be
looked upon by all, as he looked upon it, with pity—(cheers).</p>

<p>“The House shortly afterwards adjourned.”</p>

<p>Mr. Plimsoll subsequently apologised for his conduct to the House.
But it is much to be regretted, <i>on his own account</i>, that he neither
attempted to substantiate the charges he had brought against Mr. Bates,
nor asked leave to withdraw them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_292" href="#FNanchor_292" class="label">[292]</a> Already there seems to be a misapprehension. Mr. Plimsoll, as
would appear by the newspapers, has been spending his vacation on
the shores of the Black Sea and Danube, visiting the grain ports, and
instructing the masters of all vessels loading grain how to stow it in
accordance with the conditions of the new Act. That he is clearly of
opinion that inspectors should be appointed is evident from the fact
that he appointed forty of them! and that the Foreign Office approves
of what he has done! What next and next? But the Board of Trade,
by the correspondence which has been published, is of an entirely
different opinion, and maintains that the Act of Parliament gives no
such power. Nor does it! Nor should it! It is not the duty of
Government to appoint inspectors to see that its laws are carried into
effect. I say nothing as to the expense and impracticability of having
surveyors at every port in the world where a ship is to load grain;
but, if such is the meaning of the Act as applicable to grain ships, where
is this sort of legislation to end? Are we to have Government inspectors
to see to the loading of all our ships at home and abroad?
And if so, why should this new system not be applied to every branch
of commerce? Nay, why should it not extend into our houses?
Surely heavy penalties would, in the case of grain ships, be a much
more effectual mode of enforcing the conditions of the Act. Is there to
be no end to the folly of unauthorised individuals appointing surveyors
to inspect the loading of our ships abroad, or interfering with duties
alone within the power of the Executive Government? It is high time
we put a stop to these well-meaning, but Quixotic, proceedings.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_293" href="#FNanchor_293" class="label">[293]</a> I cannot understand what is meant by the word “keep.” A ship
sails in a seaworthy condition, but an accident happens on the voyage
which <i>may</i> render her “unseaworthy”: is the master, under such circumstances,
to put back to the nearest port for repairs? and if he does
not do so, and his ship is lost, it may be from causes wholly different, is
his policy of insurance to be invalid, and is he to be responsible for
any loss of life that may thus occur?</p>

table, or had dropped into the House from one of the galleries,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> he says,
“I charge the Government that they are wittingly and unwittingly, for
they are both, playing into the hands of the maritime murderers inside
the House and outside the House to secure a further continuance of
the present murderous system.”... “I desire to unmask the villains
who sit in the House, fit representatives of the more numerous, but not
greater, villains who are outside the House.” I offer no comment on
this language. It tells its own tale of the state of mind of its author.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_297" href="#FNanchor_297" class="label">[297]</a> See also evidence, W. J. Lamport, Question 5556, p. 192. With regard
to the question of overloading, Mr. Lamport made a remarkable
statement, which I do not hesitate to give at length, because it differs
entirely from an opinion prevailing at present in the public mind.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span> asked (Question 556): “From your knowledge of the
shipping in Liverpool during forty years, Do you think that there has
been a great deal of overloading?”—“Since it was intimated to me
that I was to be asked to give evidence in this room, I have been trying
to task my memory for cases in which when vessels had foundered or
had not been heard of, I myself had felt a reasonable suspicion that
the cause was overloading. I have not been able to bring to my recollection
a single instance of the kind. Now this result, I must confess,
was a little startling to myself, and in order to check it I spoke to
the overlooker of my firm, who is a man older than myself, who has
had longer experience than I have had, and who, from his outdoor
business, would probably hear of such things more frequently than I
should. The overlooker told me that he himself did not remember a
single instance, in which he had suspected that any vessel which had
left the port of Liverpool had been lost because of being overloaded.”</p>

<p>I may add, from my intimate knowledge of Mr. Lamport, which
extended over a period of thirty years up to his untimely death, that
these were no mere words of course. Indeed, the statement agrees
with my own experience; and, from the inquiries I have made elsewhere,
there are comparatively very few ships lost from overloading,
except in the coasting and short-voyage trades. In confirmation of
this opinion, the Commissioners, in their final report, state that “It is
chiefly among the small coasting vessels that any habitual overloading
prevails,” and “that there are a large number of ships in ballast annually
lost, while the losses from collisions show that the management and
negligence of sailors are not less disastrous than the carelessness of
shipowners.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_298" href="#FNanchor_298" class="label">[298]</a> It appears to me to be a grave mistake to require the insertion in the
ship’s articles of the draught of water. These articles are an agreement
between owner, master, and crew, and are binding on all. How can a
drowned sailor’s family claim compensation for a vessel being loaded
to a draught the sailor himself agreed to?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinion of
Mr.
Charles
McIver.</div>

<p>In going carefully through the evidence taken before the Royal
Commission on Unseaworthy Ships, I cannot find that any witness
objects to the principle that no ship should be allowed to proceed to
sea that is unseaworthy, nor do I find that any Shipowner would object
to a survey of his ship for the purpose of ascertaining her seaworthiness.
Indeed, Mr. Charles McIver, of Liverpool, the senior partner of
the Cunard Company, and a gentleman of great experience, though he
does not class any of his ships for somewhat the same reason as I have
stated, considers it advisable that all ships should be <i>classed</i>—not
merely certified as seaworthy, but <i>classed</i>. The Chairman (Question
9245, p. 331) remarked: “You said you would not have any objection to
have your vessels classed;” and then he asked, “Do you think it advisable
that all ships should be classed?—I think so, from what I have seen
in the last two or three years. If you will allow me, I will give another
reason. I once got nearly cast away in an unclassed vessel about forty
years ago. I was going to the States. She was a wooden vessel. I
had taken a passage in her along with my sister, because I knew the
captain of the ship. She was loaded with steam-engines and coals. I
shall not mention the ports or the owners, because they are all dead
and gone, the captain included. Off the Azores we fell in with a gale
of wind. It only lasted for twelve hours; but, if it had lasted for
twenty-four hours, she would have gone down. The captain came to
me, and said, ‘If I had known that she was as bad as this, I would not
have let you come.’ He said, ‘Her beams are away from the sides.’ I
said, ‘I know that she is making water very rapidly, because it is
coming out as clear as it went in,’ and they were pumping every two
hours, and so forth. Now, I do not mean to say that there may not be
culpability in the owner, but, sometimes, it is ignorance. So it was in
that case; they did not believe that the ship was as bad as she was.
My remark to the captain was, ‘When you go home you had better
throw up command of this vessel or you will lose your life.’ He did
so; but, in some way or other, he mixed up Mr. McIver’s name with it.
The owner said, ‘Mr. McIver is frightened.’ The captain said, ‘No, he
is not frightened, but he knows too much.’ He said, ‘I will give up
the ship.’ Now, to show you that I did not think that there was any
intentional culpability on the part of the owner, but simply ignorance,
or simply that they could do what I could not do, because I knew too
much, they gave that ship to the mate, and sent that vessel away in
his charge for a long voyage abroad, and she did it safely. The next
voyage she was never heard of. Now, any sort of classing, I think,
would have prevented that ship from going to sea.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_302" href="#FNanchor_302" class="label">[302]</a> The writer of a letter which appeared in the ‘Nautical Magazine,’
headed “‘Lloyd’s Register’ and the Great Steam Lines,” and which
was afterwards published separately (Pewtress &amp; Co. London. 1872),
says, “It is very remarkable that the classing of large steamers with
Lloyd’s was nearly wholly omitted until 1870;” arising, I may add,
from the fact that the ‘Liverpool Register’ allowed, in such ships,
scantlings and arrangements of which Lloyd’s surveyors disapproved.
“But,” continues the same writer a little further on, “it is much more
remarkable that February 1870 is the date of Lloyd’s new rules, which
are, it is supposed, an abandonment of the principle and scantlings of
the old rules.” We have here exemplified in the most forcible manner
the evils of competing classification associations.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_303" href="#FNanchor_303" class="label">[303]</a> Safety depends much more on the nature of the cargo, and the
manner in which it is stowed, than most people, or even some shipowners,
suppose. Dead weight, when stowed close and very low, while
it makes a vessel stiff—that is, “stand up” to a heavy pressure of
canvas, makes her roll in a calm when there is a heavy swell (like the
pendulum of a clock), to the injury of her spars and rigging, and, not
unfrequently, to roll her masts overboard. Railway and other bar iron,
which is now a very common description of cargo, should always be
stowed in a triangular form, and the heavier the bars the wider should
be the angles. Ores of every description, on an oversea voyage, should
be stowed in a boxed hold, or on platforms in the centre of the ship,
thoroughly blocked from the sides. In a word, the proper stowage of
a ship, whether as regards her form or the nature of her cargo, is a
science which has not been sufficiently studied.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_304" href="#FNanchor_304" class="label">[304]</a> We must ever remember that although, since we relieved our Shipowners
of all the restrictions to which they were subjected by the
Navigation Laws, they have advanced above all other nations, the
shipping of many of those nations are now running them a very close race.
If we burden them with load-lines, which prevent them from carrying
as much cargo with safety as a foreign vessel would be allowed to do—half
a foot, or even three inches less depth may deprive them of all
their profit—or saddle them with charges for surveys and so forth,
already very heavy, and to which their competitors are not subjected,
we, in either case, drive them from the trade. We must further, if we
adopt the principle of a certificate of seaworthiness, recollect the
interests of a great number of small coasters, and carefully consider
if it would not <i>seriously</i> affect them.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_306" href="#FNanchor_306" class="label">[306]</a> The following graphic description of the state of too many of our
ordinary merchant vessels when they sail is so true that I do not
hesitate to transfer it to these pages. I do so with the hope that the
Legislature may direct its earliest attention to the improvement of the
lamentable state of things here described, and with the conviction that
the first step towards that improvement would be the abolition of the
system of advances to seamen: “The ship is about to leave the dock,
when the crew, generally of a very inferior description, are brought on
board, and, frequently, in such a state of intoxication that they are
worse than useless during that day, and the ship must anchor for the
night. Next day the motley crew commence work reluctantly, in a
thoroughly strange ship, under strange officers, and are strangers to
each other. The chief officer has the unenviable task of getting them
into order, not having a man that he can depend upon. Yet it is from
that strange crew he must select look-out men, helmsmen, and leadsmen
during the ten or twelve hours’ darkness of the following night.”—Extract

<p><i>Convention of Commerce between his Britannic Majesty and the most
Christian King, together with two additional Articles annexed,
signed at London, 26th January, 1826.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Article 1.—French vessels coming from or departing for the
ports of France, or if in ballast, coming from or departing from
any place, shall not be subject in the ports of the United Kingdom,
either on entering into or departing from the same, to any
higher duties of tonnage, harbour, lighthouse, pilotage, quarantine,
or other similar or corresponding duties, of whatever nature,
or under whatever denomination, than those to which British
vessels, in respect of the same voyages, are or may be subject,
on entering into or departing from such ports; and, reciprocally,
from and after the same period, British vessels coming from or
departing for the ports of the United Kingdom, or if in ballast,
coming from or departing for any place, shall not be subject, in
the ports of France, either in entering into or departing from
the same, to any higher duties of tonnage, harbour, lighthouse,
pilotage, quarantine, or other similar or corresponding duties, of
whatever nature, or under whatever denomination, than those
to which French vessels, in respect of the same voyages, are or
may be subject on entering into or departing from such ports,
whether such duties are collected separately or are consolidated
in one and the same duty, his most Christian Majesty reserving
to himself to regulate the amount of such duty or duties in
France, according to the rate at which they are or may be established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</span>
in the United Kingdom, at the same time, with a view
of diminishing the burdens imposed upon the navigation of the
two countries. His most Christian Majesty will always be disposed
to reduce the amount of the said burdens in France in
proportion to any reduction which may hereafter be made of
those now levied in the ports of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>2. Goods which can or may be legally imported into the ports
of the United Kingdom from the ports of France, if so imported
in French vessels, shall be subject to no higher duties than if
imported in British vessels; and, reciprocally, which can or
may be legally imported into the ports of France from the ports
of the United Kingdom, if so imported in British vessels, shall
be subject to no higher duties than if imported in French vessels.
The produce of Asia, Africa, and America, not being allowed to
be imported from the said countries, nor from any other in
French vessels, nor from France in French, British, or any other
vessels into the ports of the United Kingdom for home consumption,
but only for warehousing and re-exportation, his most
Christian Majesty reserves to himself to direct that in like
manner the produce of Asia, Africa, and America shall not be
imported from the said countries, nor from any other, in British
vessels, nor from the United Kingdom in British, French, or any
other vessels into the ports of France for the consumption of that
kingdom, but only for warehousing and re-exportation.</p>

<p>With regard to the productions of the countries of Europe, it
is understood between the high contracting parties that such
productions shall not be imported in British ships into France
for the consumption of that kingdom, unless such ships shall
have been laden therewith in some port of the United Kingdom;
that his Britannic Majesty may adopt, if he shall think fit, some
corresponding restrictive measure with regard to the productions
of the countries of Europe imported into the ports of the United
Kingdom in French vessels, the high contracting parties reserving
to themselves the power of making by mutual consent
such relaxation in the strict execution of the present article as
they may think useful to the respective interests of the two
countries upon the principle of mutual concessions, affording
each to the other reciprocal or equivalent advantages.</p>

<p>3. All goods which can or may be legally exported from the
ports of either of the two countries shall on their export pay the
same duties of exportation, whether the exportation of such
goods be made in British or French vessels, provided the said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</span>
vessels proceed, respectively, direct from the ports of the one
country to the other. And all the said goods so exported in
British or French vessels shall be reciprocally entitled to the
same bounties, drawbacks, and other allowances of the same
nature which are granted by the regulations of each country
respectively.</p>

<p>4. It is mutually agreed between the high contracting parties
that in the intercourse of navigation between the two countries
the vessels of any third power shall in no case obtain more
favourable conditions than those stipulated in the present convention
in favour of British and French vessels.</p>

<p>5. The fishing-boats of either of the two countries which may
be forced by stress of weather to seek shelter in the ports or on
the coast of the other country shall not be subject to any duties
or port charges of any description whatever; provided the said
boats when so driven in by stress of weather shall not discharge
or receive on board any cargo, or portion of cargo, in the ports
or on the parts of the coast where they shall have sought
shelter.</p>

<p>6. It is agreed that the provisions of the present convention
between the high contracting parties shall be reciprocally
extended and in force in all the possessions subject to their
respective dominions in Europe.</p>

<p>7. The present convention shall be in force for a term of
ten years from the 5th April of the present year; and further,
until the end of twelve months after either of the high contracting
parties shall have given notice to the other of its
intention to terminate its operation; each of the high contracting
parties reserving to itself the right of giving such notice to
the other at the end of the said term of ten years, and it is
agreed between them that at the end of twelve months’ extension
agreed on both sides this convention and all the stipulations
thereof shall cease and determine.</p>

<p>8. The present convention shall be ratified, and the ratifications
shall be exchanged in London within the space of one month, or
sooner if possible.</p>

<p>In witness whereof, the respective plenipotentiaries have
signed the same, and have affixed thereto the seals of their arms.</p>

<p>Done at London on 26th day of January, 1826.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Additional Articles.</i></p>

<p>Article 1.—French vessels shall be allowed to sail from any
port whatever of the countries under the dominion of his most
Christian Majesty, to all the colonies of the United Kingdom
(except those possessed by the East India Company) and to import
into the said colonies all kinds of merchandise (being productions
the growth or manufacture of France) with the exception of
such as are prohibited to be imported into the said colonies, or
are permitted to be imported only from countries under the
British dominion; and the said French vessels, as well as the
merchandise imported in the same, shall not be subject in
the colonies of the United Kingdom to other or higher duties
than those to which British vessels may be subject, or importing
the same merchandise from any foreign country, or which are
imposed on the merchandise itself.</p>

<p>2. French vessels shall be allowed to export from all the
colonies of the United Kingdom (except those of East India
Company) all kinds of merchandise which are not prohibited to
be exported from such colonies in vessels other than those of
Great Britain; and the said vessels, as well as the merchandise
exported in the same, shall not be subject to other or higher
duties than those to which British vessels may be subject on
exporting the said merchandise, or which are imposed on the
merchandise itself, and they shall be entitled, to the same
bounties, drawbacks, and other allowances of the same nature to
which British vessels would be entitled on such exportation.
These two additional articles shall have the same force and
validity as if they were inserted word for word in the convention
signed this day. They shall be ratified, and the ratifications
shall be exchanged at the same time.</p>

<p>In witness whereof, the respective plenipotentiaries have
signed the same, and have affixed thereto the seals of their
arms.</p>

<p>A Treasury letter, dated 28th March, 1826, directs that French
vessels and their cargoes legally imported or exported on board
the same, according to the terms of the convention in the preceding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</span>
pages, are from 5th April, 1826, to be charged with such
and like duties only of whatever kind they may be that are charged
on British vessels and similar cargoes laden on board thereof,
and in like manner the same bounties, drawbacks, and allowances
are to be paid on articles exported in French vessels that are
paid, granted, or allowed on similar articles exported in British
vessels. And the necessary instructions are to be transmitted to
the officers in the colonies for carrying into effect the stipulations
contained in the two additional articles of the said convention
respecting French vessels and their cargoes from 1st October,
1826.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 1em;">Boston, United States,</span><br>
21st September, 1860.<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond was good enough to read to me a letter
which Lord John Russell had addressed to your Lordship on the
subject of my visit to the United States. As reports have been
current since then that my visit to this country was one of a
semi-official character, I may remark that I am here merely in
search of a little recreation after the labours of the session. But
as I am intimate with many of the leading Shipowners and merchants
of this country, Lord John Russell was pleased to furnish
me with copies of the correspondence which had passed between
our own Government and that of the United States with regard to
various maritime questions (to which, as your Lordship may be
aware, my attention has for some years been directed), in the
hope that I might be able to aid your Lordship in their
settlement.</p>

<p>These papers I have studied on the passage to this place. I
see they deal with questions of very considerable importance to
both countries; but there are also others which equally impede
our commercial intercourse, and all these various questions are
well worthy of consideration, and should be adjusted as soon as
possible. They are:—</p>

<p>1st. The rules of the road at sea and collisions.</p>

<p>2nd. Signal lights.</p>

<p>3rd. Limitation of Shipowners’ liability.</p>

<p>4th. The Foreign Deserter’s Act.</p>

<p>5th. The punishment of offences committed on the high seas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</span></p>

<p>6th. The settlement of disputes between the masters of ships
and their crews in foreign ports; and the extension of the use
of our shipping offices to the vessels of the United States.</p>

<p>There are, besides these questions, others of a much more difficult
and delicate character, such as belligerent rights of sea, the
coasting trade of the United States, and the registration in
America of British-built ships, all of great political as well as
commercial importance, and therefore I fear my services in their
solution can be of little value. It is, however, my intention
to enter into conversation bearing upon all these questions with
the leading merchants and Shipowners to whom I am known;
and with the Presidents of the Chambers of Commerce of this
and other places, including New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,
Portland, and various seaports in the New England States to
whom I have letters of introduction. I shall at least ascertain
their views, and may thus be enabled to pave the way to the
settlement of some of those questions. And if I find that their
views can be brought into harmony with those entertained by
our own Government, I shall endeavour to prevail upon the
different bodies to memorialise their Government on the subject.</p>

<p>My first, and I fear imperfect, impressions in regard to the
questions I have named may be briefly stated as follows:—</p>

<p>1st. <i>The rules of the road at sea.</i>—I think these rules should be
the same for the vessels of all nations. Different opinions prevail
in regard to our own rules; but, though they differ from the old
maritime law (acted upon by almost every other nation and at
times by ourselves), and are an improvement upon it, the decisions
in our Admiralty Courts are too often conflicting. Our rules,
as a whole, are perhaps, however, more satisfactory than those
of any other. But be that as it may, it would be most desirable
if all nations would agree to adopt one and the same rule of road
at sea, and would tend greatly to the safety of life and property.</p>

<p>2nd. <i>Signal lights.</i>—Our recent regulations in regard to lights
have answered very well, and have been adopted by the owners
of steam-vessels belonging to the United States. The application
of these rules to sailing vessels is all that is now necessary,
and is very desirable.</p>

<p>3rd. <i>The limitation of shipowners’ liability.</i>—This is a question
of great importance, and the laws in regard to it are in an unsatisfactory
state. May I refer your Lordship to the evidence
taken last session before the select committee on merchant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</span>
shipping on this subject, and to their report? From the correspondence
I have read I think the Government of the United
States might be induced to adopt the principles laid down in
that report. If so, it might then (as the laws of each country
are similar) be mutually arranged by a convention, or otherwise,
to place our ships and those of the United States respectively,
on an equal footing with regard to claims raised in the courts
of either country in respect of any loss of life or personal injury
arising from collisions at sea, so as to limit such claims to the
same extent in each case, and also that the mode of procedure
shall be as provided by the laws of the country where the claim
is made.</p>

<p>4th. <i>The application of our Foreign Deserter’s Act to the ships of
the United States.</i>—As your Lordship is aware, the United States
Government has positively declined to become a party to this Act,
because it contains the words “not being slaves,” which were
inserted, I believe, after the Bill was introduced. Now it
appears to me that there is no necessity for these words. The
Act is meant to deal solely with voluntary agents, who, having
of their own free will entered into an agreement, break it at
foreign ports. I think the case would be met if instead of the
words “not being slaves” there were substituted the following
words—“seamen who have voluntarily engaged themselves in,
or apprentices duly indentured to, the sea service.” I question
if there are any cases on record where slaves have been shipped
as seamen to English ports.</p>

<p>5th. <i>Offences committed on the high seas.</i>—Your Lordship cannot
fail to be aware of the unsatisfactory state of the law in regard
to these offences. Why, <i>on the representation of the ministers or
consuls</i>, should the courts of England and of the United States
not have jurisdiction over offences committed on board of vessels
of the respective countries? I ask this question because I can
at present see no objection to the principle I have ventured to
lay down, though the mode of putting it into practice would
require some consideration, and could best be dealt with by the
legal authorities of the two countries. The same may be said
with regard to the settlement of disputes between masters and
crews in the ports of either country.</p>

<p>6th. <i>The extension of our shipping offices to the vessels of the United
States.</i>—If the Government of the United States would not agree
to establish similar offices and a machinery somewhat in accordance
with our own (I see no reason why such offices which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</span>
have answered so well in England should not be adopted), then
we might stipulate that all British seamen entering the service
of American Shipowners in the ports of Great Britain should be
engaged before our shipping masters, and we might grant to
American shipowners the privilege of engaging <i>all</i> the seamen
their vessels required (when in any of the ports of Great
Britain), through the medium of our offices, on the same conditions
as our own shipowners now engage their seamen. This would
pave the way to an international arrangement, and tend to abolish
the system of crimpage which still prevails to a great extent
in our ports, and is alike injurious to the interests of British and
American shipowners.</p>

<p>Though belligerent rights, the coasting trade, and the admission
of British-<i>built</i> ships to American registration are difficult questions
for me to deal with, involving as they do the policy of the
respective nations bearing upon other interests than those of
commerce, I may remark that it is easy of proof in regard
to the two latter that the policy of the United States, while
it is unjust towards England, is injurious to the people of
America, and contrary to the principles laid down by their
own most eminent statesmen in their intercourse with other
countries. Nevertheless, I fear the Government of the United
States will not be disposed to make concessions unless we
are prepared to make a <i>bargain</i> with them. With that object
in view, I think if we agreed to relieve the shipowners of
the United States from the charge of light dues on our coast
(which have been the source of great complaint), and also from
compulsory pilotage as recommended in the merchant shipping
report; provided they opened to us the trade between their
eastern and western ports, <i>viâ</i> Panama and round Cape Horn, if
not prepared to throw open entirely their coasting trade, some
progress might be made. The Government of the United States
might also be induced to make some concession with regard to the
registration of British-built ships, for through the want of <i>iron
screw</i> vessels (which cannot be produced at as moderate a price
in the States) they are fast losing the most valuable portion of
the trade between England and this country. And their coasting
trade (especially that on the inland lakes) is not developed to
one-half the extent it would be if the Shipowners of America
were allowed to own the description of vessels I have named.
They are also losing the share they once had of the Newfoundland
fisheries from the fact that we can produce in the colonies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</span>
vessels adapted for that trade at 25 per cent. less cost than they
can build and equip similar vessels.</p>

<p>I daresay your Lordship can form little idea of the hindrance
to commerce and the constant irritation the questions I have
named create on both sides of the Atlantic; and I hope by
holding intercourse with the people of this country to pave the
way, as I have said, for the settlement of at least <i>some of them</i>.
With that object I shall take notes of the opinions entertained
by the members of the different Chambers of Commerce and
Boards of Trade throughout this country, and also the views of
those members of the government whom I may meet, and which
I shall forward to your Lordship, and if you think any satisfactory
results are likely to follow, you may then deem it
desirable to communicate with Lord John Russell, with a view
of entering into formal negotiations with the Government of the
United States. I have for many years anxiously desired to see
settled these various questions, considering their settlement of
great importance to both countries; and if I can, in the way I
propose, aid your Lordship in this good work, my long promised
visit to this country, though made with no such object, will not
be made in vain.</p>

<p>I am directed by Lord Stanley to acknowledge the receipt
of your letter of the 31st ultimo, in which you call his Lordship’s
attention to the state of relations existing between this country
and the United States with regard to the Navigation Laws;
and in expressing to you Lord Stanley’s thanks for this further
communication, I am to inform you that the same has been referred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</span>
to the Board of Trade, whose observations thereupon will
be communicated to you as soon as their answer shall have been
received; and the delay in receiving their report is the reason
for your letter not having been sooner acknowledged.</p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>With reference to my letter of the 21st instant, I am
directed by Lord Stanley to state to you that his Lordship is
fully alive to the importance of the points on which you have
urged that a satisfactory understanding is desirable with the
United States, but that since the date of your letter to Lord
Lyons of the 21st of September, 1860, the first two of the seven
questions enumerated in it have been settled by the adoption of
one uniform system of rules of the road, and of lights to be carried
at sea by maritime nations generally, including the United
States.</p>

<p>As regards the third question, viz., the limitation of shipowners’
liability, the Lords of Trade have pointed out to Lord
Stanley that the law of this country has undergone some modification
since 1860. By the Merchant Shipping Acts Amendment
Act, 1862, the limit of such liability was readjusted, and
the limitation was extended to foreign ships in cases arising in
British courts concerning matters within their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Inasmuch, however, as this extension was not made specially
for the benefit of foreigners, but with the view of establishing
a just and uniform rule of law, no steps were taken to secure
reciprocal legislation in foreign countries.</p>

<p>If the law at present in force in the United States is liable to
the same objection as the law formerly in force in this country,
and is found to be attended with the inconveniences which were
experienced here, it may be presumed that the United States
Government will probably find it for their interest to amend it
in a similar sense and on similar grounds; but Lord Stanley sees
no reason at present for opening special communications with
that Government on the subject.</p>

<p>With respect to the remaining four questions alluded to in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</span>
your letter, I am to state to you that the matters to which they
relate are under consideration.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge receipt of your letters of 21st and
26th inst., and I am glad to learn that two of the questions to
which I ventured to direct your Lordship’s attention have, since
1860, been settled in a satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>As regards the third, viz., the limitation of shipowners’ liability,
may I trouble you with an extract herewith<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</span>
‘New York Herald’ of 10th October, 1860, as the question is
therein, I think, correctly stated. Since then I am aware that
there has been an amendment in our law relating to the liability
of Shipowners; but it would appear from the communication
you have received from the Lords of Trade that while we have
extended the limitation to foreign ships in cases arising in
British courts, we have overlooked altogether the still more
important part of the question so far as this country is concerned,
and that is the unlimited liability of British shipowners in cases
arising in foreign courts. If such is the fact, then we, I fear,
have neglected a favourable opportunity of inviting foreign
nations to place our ships in their courts on the same terms as
we had placed their ships when thrown into our courts. Had
we done so, I think the Government of the United States would
have readily met us in so just and reasonable a request.</p>

<p>Considering, then, the position in which British shipowners
would be placed if an action was raised against them in foreign
courts for the recovery of claims arising through a collision at
sea, your Lordship will perceive that this is not a question in
which foreigners alone are interested, for we have given them
all they asked in our courts, but one which deeply affects the
interests of British subjects, and which, now more than ever,
requires adjustment by special communication with the United
States and those other countries where the responsibility of
British shipowners is still unlimited. Since we have conceded
all they require, it may be found more difficult now to obtain the
necessary alterations in their law than it would have been at the
time to which my previous communications referred; but I
daresay that when the justice of our claim is represented, steps
will still be taken to grant in their courts the same limitation of
responsibility to our Shipowners as we have granted to their
Shipowners in our courts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</span></p>

Foreign Office, 14th November, 1866.<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>With reference to your letter of the 29th September last
regarding the laws of the United States and of other foreign
countries, with regard to the liability of British shipowners in
cases of loss by collisions at sea, I am directed by Lord Stanley
to inform you that his Lordship learns from the Lords of Trade
that, by the common law of this country, and by the maritime
law, as administered in our Admiralty Courts, the Shipowner
was formerly personally liable to the whole extent of his fortune
for any damage done by his ships through default of his servants.
The legislature, however, long since passed statutes limiting
the liability, and the limitation, with some variations, still
continues.</p>

<p>It was, however, held that the statutes being municipal laws,
did not affect cases where foreign ships were concerned, and
where the collision or casualty happened on the high seas, but
that such cases must be governed by the general maritime law
of the world, which was assumed to be the same with our common
law. This was, perhaps, too hastily assumed, inasmuch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</span>
as most maritime countries adopted the principle of limiting the
Shipowners’ liability much earlier, and to a greater extent than
Great Britain.</p>

<p>The consequence was, that if a collision happened between
two British ships, the British law of liability applied, and whichever
might be in fault, the liability was limited. On the other
hand, if a collision happened between a British and a foreign
ship on the high seas, or between two foreign ships on the high
seas, and the case came into our courts, then whichever was in
fault, the liability was unlimited.</p>

<p>This law was unequal, but in no way specially injurious to
the foreigner. The British ship, if in fault, was equally liable
with the foreigner; and as the British ship is generally to be
found at home, and as the British shipowner resides here, the
British shipowner being thus more likely to be the defendant,
was likely the more often to suffer.</p>

<p>The law was consequently altered by making the limitation
of liability apply in all cases coming into our courts, whether
the ships were both British or both foreign, or one British and
one foreign.</p>

<p>And as the change was simply an improvement of our own
law, and conferred no especial advantage upon foreigners, it was
not thought necessary or desirable to delay it for the purpose of
obtaining similar changes when desirable in the laws of foreign
nations.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>I received in due course your Lordship’s letter of the
14th inst., which does not, however, appear to me to touch the
main point of my previous communication, viz., the unlimited liability
to which our Shipowners would still be subjected in cases
of collision arising in various foreign courts. For instance, if
one of our Transatlantic steam ships engaged in the conveyance
of our mails came into collision—a very possible event—with
one of the numerous steam vessels owned in the United States,
freighted with passengers, cargo, and specie, of great value, the
consequences, under the existing law of that country, might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</span>
prove not only most disastrous to the owners of the British ship,
but also very detrimental to the public service.</p>

<p>As I understand the law of the United States, the owners of
our mail steamer, if at fault, would be responsible to the full
extent of their means for all the loss the owners of the American
steamer had sustained; if so, the result would be the seizure of
the British steamer whenever she reached an American port; and,
possibly, if the loss sustained was very great, the seizure of all
the vessels in port belonging to the same owner, and thus our
mail service for the time might be suspended.</p>

<p>It is to this grave contingency I am anxious to direct your
Lordship’s attention, in the hope that you may see the urgent
necessity of taking such steps as you may deem most expedient
to induce the Government of the United States to place our
vessels in their courts on the same footing in regard to the
limitation of liability as we now place the owners of their vessels
in our courts.</p>

No. 7,” of the 14th November last, on the liability imposed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</span>
the laws of the United States on Shipowners in cases of collision,
I have the honour to enclose copy of an opinion of Mr. Carlisle,
the legal adviser of this Legation.</p>

<p>Your Lordships will gather from it that the principle of
limited liability has been adopted by the laws of the United
States, and is applied in the Federal courts. But the injured
party may apply to a State court if the defendant is within its
jurisdiction, and bring an action on the case, and it is doubtful
whether such a court would limit the measure of damages by
the principles contained in the Act of Congress.</p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>I have the honour to return herewith the papers in relation
to the question of the liability of Shipowners in cases of
collision.</p>

<p>The only Act of Congress touching the subject is that of March
3rd, 1851, which in its third section limits the liability in such
cases. A copy of this section is enclosed herewith. This language
is explicit and comprehensive, making no distinction on
account of the nationality of the ship; nor have I been able to
find that such a distinction has been suggested in any adjudicated
case under this statute.</p>

<p>For my own part I entertain no doubt that the limitation of
liability which it prescribes would be held in all <i>courts of the
United States</i> as applying equally to foreign as to American
ships.</p>

<p>The Courts of Admiralty are, by the constitution of the United
States, exclusively of the Federal Government. If therefore
the remedy in cases of collision were exclusively in Admiralty
Courts, the Act of 1851 would completely cover the question.</p>

<p>But there is a remedy at common law, which is open to the
injured party at his election. He may maintain his action on
the case, which is a transitory action, wherever he can find the
owner of the offending vessel, in the same manner and to be
determined by the same principles as if the plaintiff’s coach or
his person had been injured by a collision occasioned by the
unskilful driving of the defendant’s coach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</span></p>

<p>Such an action may be brought in any court of general jurisdiction
in any of the States of the Union; and it may be doubted
whether this Act of Congress would be available to limit the
measure of damages in these courts, though undoubtedly a convention
between Great Britain and the United States, with a
proper Act of Congress to carry it into effect, would accomplish
the object.</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of yesterday’s
date, with copy of a despatch and inclosures, received through
the Foreign Office from her Majesty’s Minister at Washington.
By these documents it would appear that the laws of the United
States of America, so far as regards the responsibility of British
Shipowners in their courts, are the same as they were in 1860,
and that, practically, our responsibility is there still unlimited.
This is a very unsatisfactory state of things, and, as I have
already explained to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
might produce the most disastrous results to some of our Shipowners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</span>
in their intercourse with the United States. I, therefore,
trust that the Board of Trade may be induced to use its best
efforts to obtain as soon as possible a convention, whereby our
ships frequenting the ports of the United States may, so far as
regards responsibility, be placed upon the same footing as we
have now placed in all our courts the vessels belonging to that
country.</p>

<p>I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the

to the question of the liability of British Shipowners in the
United States, that that liability appears to be practically unlimited,
and trusting that this Board may take steps to obtain
complete reciprocity.</p>

<p>In reply, I am to point out to you that the principle of limited
liability has been adopted in the Federal Courts, and is applied
in all the Federal Courts of the United States—<i>i.e.</i> in all
Admiralty and Vice Admiralty Courts, to foreign as well as
American ships.</p>

<p>It seems true, however, that an injured person may possibly
maintain an action against the owner of an offending vessel in a
State Court, and it must depend on the law of each State in that
case, whether the measure of damages would be limited. But
not to mention the difficulty of first ascertaining, and procuring
the alteration of the law of each State, it is to be observed that
to maintain such action the owner of the offending vessel must
be found within the jurisdiction of the State Court. This, in
fact, amounts to a practical limitation, seeing that he has all the
advantages of limited liability so long as he keeps away from the
United States, or is not to be found within the jurisdiction of the
court in question.</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th
inst., but it is very little satisfaction to know that the principle of
limited liability is applied in all the Federal Courts of the United
States to British Shipowners, whilst in all the State Courts of
that country their responsibility is altogether unlimited. To say
that they have the advantages of limited liability, so long as they
keep away from the ports of that country, is to suggest that if
we wish to avoid unlimited responsibility, we must renounce
our carrying-trade with America.</p>

<p>The Board of Trade would also appear to be under the impression
that there is so little chance of any serious claim ever
being made, that the alteration of the law of the States is of
little consequence to us, and that it is not worthy of the trouble
it would involve; but a case in point has just come under my
notice which signally illustrates the force of the remonstrative
observations I have ventured to make.</p>

<p>The screw steam-ship <i>Keder</i>, belonging to Messrs. G. and I.
Burns, of Glasgow, and their partners, sailed from New York
31st August, 1864, and on the following day came into collision
with the <i>Czarina</i>, an American barque, of from 500 to 600 tons,
which had on board a cargo of sulphur, shumac, and fruit. The
<i>Czarina</i> was abandoned in a sinking state. As the evidence
shows that the <i>Keder</i> was not to blame, the owners of that vessel
hoped that nothing more would be heard of the matter; but
only a few days ago they received a letter from Sir Edward
Cunard, their correspondent at New York, stating that he had
just been called upon to give bond for one hundred and twenty-five
thousand dollars, on account of the cargo of the <i>Czarina</i>,
and adding that he had also been called upon to give bond for
the vessel, though the amount in the latter case is not mentioned.
It is estimated that the value put on the <i>Czarina</i> and
cargo will be something like 40,000<i>l.</i> Supposing the <i>Keder</i> to
be in fault, her liability, according to British law, would be
restricted to 8<i>l.</i> per ton of her own gross tonnage, viz. 14,264<i>l.</i>,
whereas, according to the law of the State of New York, she may
be held liable in this case for 40,000<i>l.</i>, being more than double
her value; and if the <i>Czarina</i> and cargo had been more valuable
than they are stated to be, the liability of the owner of the
<i>Keder</i> would of course have been correspondingly increased. In
a word, <i>it would have been practically without limit</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</span></p>

<p>I am aware that there may be some difficulty in obtaining an
alteration of the law, but this ought not to be any obstacle when
the interests at stake are so very large and of so grave a character.
If the proper representation is made, I think the Government
of the United States cannot now hesitate to place our
vessels in <i>all</i> their courts on the same terms as we have recently
placed their vessels in all our courts, and if the executive is
prepared to enter into a convention, having that object in view,
it will no doubt be confirmed by Congress.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Note.</i>—This correspondence was not at all satisfactory to me, but as I was
then in a very precarious state of health, I sent copies of it to Mr. John Burns,
whose firm (the Cunard Company) was more deeply interested in the matter
to which it refers than any other. He followed it up with his usual energy
and ability, and through his exertions the responsibility of British Shipowners
has now been limited in the <i>States</i>, as well as in the Federal Courts
of the United States of America, to the same extent as the Shipowners of that
country would be held liable in an action, through loss at sea by collision
or otherwise, brought against them in this country. See Parliamentary

<p class="right">
Paris, 10th January, 1861.<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Sire</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>In accordance with your Majesty’s desire, expressed at
the interview with which you honoured me this morning, I may
here recapitulate the facts which I then brought under your
notice.</p>

<p>In the early part of last session of Parliament I brought
under the consideration of the House of Commons the following
resolution:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</span></p>

<p>“That an humble address be presented to her Majesty praying
that she may be graciously pleased to enter into negotiations
with the Emperor of the French with the view of making a
treaty for the reciprocal abrogation of all discriminating duties
levied upon the vessels and their cargoes of either of the two
nations in the ports of the other, and for procuring such alterations
in the Navigation Laws of France as may tend to facilitate the
commercial intercourse and strengthen the friendly relations
between England and France.”</p>

<p>That resolution received the unanimous approval of both
Houses of Parliament, and was submitted for your Majesty’s
consideration through his Excellency Earl Cowley in the usual
form. And, now I have to thank your Majesty very cordially
for granting me an audience together with his Lordship, so that
I might explain more fully the object of that resolution in its
relation to the maritime commerce of France. Sire, the Navigation
Laws of France may be divided into five distinct heads:—</p>

<p>1st. The coasting trade, which is confined entirely to French
ships, all other vessels entering it being, I believe, liable with
their cargoes to confiscation, with the exception of Spanish vessels
employed on a particular branch of that trade.</p>

<p>2ndly. The colonial trade, that is, the trade between the colonies
and possessions of France and the mother country, which is also
confined entirely to the ships of France.</p>

<p>3rdly. The foreign trade, as, for instance, the trade between
France and America, or between France and the Brazils, and
other foreign countries, which is confined to the ships of France
and those of the respective nations with which France has
entered into treaties of reciprocity.</p>

<p>4thly. The direct trade with England, which comprises commerce
carried on between the ports of Great Britain and the
ports of France. This trade is confined to the vessels of England,
and France, and the ships of the respective countries are,
with some slight exception, placed on the same footing in the
ports of either country.</p>

<p>5thly. The direct trade between France and the colonies and
possessions of Great Britain, which, practically, is confined to the
ships of France, as the differential duties, to which I shall hereafter
refer, on nearly every article of produce are so high as
against English ships that they are prevented from entering the
trade.</p>

<p>Now, it is a remarkable fact that in those branches of trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</span>
where French shipping is placed in competition with the shipping
of other nations, it is making more progress than in those
branches of trade where it is protected, at an enormous cost to
the people of France. Indeed, the French shipping employed in
those carefully protected branches of commerce has, as appears
by the returns, in some instances actually declined. But this
state of things is not confined merely to the shipping of France.
It has been so throughout all time and with all nations. I shall
endeavour to illustrate this to your Majesty by reference to the
official returns of the progress of shipping belonging to my own
country. Going as far back as 1720, I find that there cleared
outwards from the ports of Great Britain, 430,000 tons of British
shipping.</p>

<p>In 1810 the clearances amounted to 1,600,000 tons.</p>

<p>Ten years afterwards, in 1820, they had only increased to
1,670,000 tons, but in 1850 they had reached 4,700,000 tons.</p>

<p>That increase, however great, is nevertheless small when
compared with the increase which took place after Great Britain,
in 1850, swept away the last remnants of her Navigation Laws,
and threw open her ports unreservedly to the ships of the world.
In 1858, the clearances of British ships outwards employed in
the over-sea trade, to which these returns alone have reference,
reached 6,400,000 tons.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that in ninety years of the closest protection,
when we guarded our ships with the most unusual care, and
protected them in every branch of our trade to the detriment of
our revenue, and by increased taxation upon the people, our
shipping increased only 1,170,000 tons; whereas, in thirty years
of partial free-trade, during which we entered into treaties of
reciprocity with almost every nation, our shipping increased
3,000,000 tons, and in eight years of perfect free trade, that is,
from 1850, when our Navigation Laws were entirely repealed,
our shipping increased 1,740,000 tons, or, in round numbers,
600,000 tons more than it increased in ninety years of the
closest protection. But it may be well to compare the relative
progress of French and British shipping. By comparing the
tonnage owned by the respective countries in 1838 and 1858,
your Majesty will find that in the last twenty years France has
increased her sailing vessels by 370,000 tons, and her steam
ships by 50,000 tons. But England, during the same period,
has increased her sailing vessels by no less than 2,800,000 tons,
and her steam ships by 400,000 tons. Thus the Shipowners of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</span>
England, who are left to depend upon their own energies and
their own resources, are moving onwards at a rate eight times
greater than that of the Shipowners of France, who, by means
of protection, are taught to depend upon the State instead of
upon themselves and upon the vast natural resources which
their country affords. It is a mistake to suppose, as many
persons do, that France has not facilities for carrying on a great
maritime commerce. Her seaboard is almost as great as our
own; she has no less than 150 leagues of coast in the Channel,
130 leagues on the Atlantic, and 90 leagues of coast on the
Mediterranean. Along her seaboard there are many fine harbours,
some of them easy of access, and at points convenient to
the great markets of the world. I need hardly mention the
position of Havre as affording great facilities for carrying on a
large commerce with the United States and the continent of
America, generally, nor that of Marseilles, in its contiguity with
India, and the vast commerce of the East. But allow me to
direct your Majesty’s attention to a remarkable contrast which
may be drawn between two great branches of the trade of your
own dominions. While your shipping is comparatively at a
standstill, your special commerce is increasing with considerable
rapidity, for I find that in ten years, from 1827 to 1836, the increase
was 10,000,000 francs; from 1837 to 1846, 15,000,000 francs,
but from 1847 to 1856 the increase was 22,000,000 francs in that
particular branch of commerce, which is confined entirely to the
produce and manufactures of France. To carry on this important
and steadily increasing trade your Majesty is obliged to depend
very materially upon the shipping of other countries, for I find
that in 1858, while the total entries at French ports amounted
to 4,162,000 tons, no less than 2,550,000 tons consisted of foreign
shipping.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to conceive the amount of money which
the people of France are annually paying in, as it appears, a
vain attempt, to encourage its shipping: I use the word “vain”
because it is clear, if the experience of other nations, or the experience
of your own nation is of any value, that all the money
paid to “encourage shipping” is actually lost, for French ships,
with all this protection, do not increase at the same rate as
other nations, or at the same rates in the branches of your own
trade, where they are guarded with unusual care, as they do in
those branches where they are thrown into competition with the
shipping of other countries. It would be impossible to ascertain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</span>
the loss the people of France annually sustain, directly and
indirectly, through the operation of its Navigation Laws. I
have, however, analysed it in one small branch of trade. In
1858, there cleared from the Island of Mauritius, 180,000 tons of
shipping. The trade which that island carries on with France is,
through the operation of the differential duties, confined to the
vessels of France. In a word, they have a monopoly of it.
Analysing the commercial circulars issued at that island, I find
that the excess of freight paid at the Mauritius to French ships
for “a market,” or for the ports of France, amounted in that
year to 300,000<i>l.</i> more than the people of England paid for a
similar quantity of sugar imported from the Mauritius.</p>

<p>I have mentioned to your Majesty the differential duties still
in force, but which in practice are unproductive to the revenue,
because, as you will see by the following scale, they are so great
that merchants are prohibited from shipping in any other than
French bottoms. For instance, sugar pays a duty of 68<i>s.</i> per
100 kilogrammes if imported in French vessels, but 84<i>s.</i> if in
English, from any of our colonies and possessions. Coffee in
French ships is charged 48<i>s.</i> per 100 kilogrammes, and 84<i>s.</i> if in
English vessels. Tobacco, if imported in French ships, pays 4<i>s.</i>
per kilogramme, but double that duty if imported in English
vessels. Other articles, the produce of our Eastern possessions,
are taxed in somewhat similar proportions, so that your Majesty
will see that your merchants and manufacturers are thus practically
prohibited from using any other than French vessels to
convey whatever produce they may require from the colonies
and possessions of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Your Majesty has just concluded a Treaty of Commerce with
England, which I feel certain will benefit alike the people of
Great Britain and of France, and no doubt develop the trade of
the respective countries to a far greater extent than many persons
suppose; above all, it cannot fail to strengthen the friendly
relations now happily existing between the Governments of the
two countries, and which I most sincerely trust may long continue.
That treaty will, however, be seriously clogged in its
operations, unless there is a change in the Navigation Laws of
France. I shall endeavour to show how.</p>

<p>The produce and manufactures of France will not, in all cases,
be paid for either in coin or by the produce and manufactures of
Great Britain, but in many instances by the produce of India,
Australia, and Canada. Yet, by the French Navigation Laws,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</span>
that produce which your own people require, cannot be imported
into France in the ships belonging to those parties who buy the
produce and the manufactures of France. No nation, as your
Majesty is well aware, can produce all that is necessary to employ,
to feed, and to clothe her own people. All nations must,
to a greater or less extent, depend upon other countries for those
necessary articles of existence. France, to keep her people employed,
must have the wools of Australia and the timber of
Canada, as well as various descriptions of raw materials which
India alone affords, or produces in greater abundance and at
lower prices, than other countries. Nevertheless, the Navigation
Laws of France prevent those articles which are required for the
very existence of the people of France from being imported in
the ships of the country whose possessions produce them. India,
as your Majesty is aware, has, within the last two years, become
virtually, since the abolition of the charter of the East India
Company, an integral part of the British Empire: therefore I
trust your Majesty will see the justice as well as the policy of at
least placing the shipping of England and France engaged in
that trade on the same footing as they have been for many
years in the trade between those two countries. Such a change
would entail no loss of revenue, nor would it, I conceive, require
more than your Majesty’s decree to effect. This change, in my
humble judgment, is indeed necessary on even more urgent
grounds than the development of the Commercial Treaty which
has recently been concluded. The shipping of the world has
just passed through an ordeal of great depression. The losses
which Shipowners of all countries have sustained during the last
four years have been so great, that capital has, to a considerable
extent, ceased to flow in that direction, so much so that, by
returns now before me, I find that the tonnage built during the
year 1860 in the United States, in Canada, in New Brunswick,
in Norway, in England, and in other great producing countries,
falls far short of what it was either in 1859, or in any one of the
previous years of depression. But, on the other hand, the general
commerce of the world has, during that period, increased enormously.
For instance, by our Board of Trade returns, the
imports of cotton into Great Britain, which amounted to about
8,000,000 cwt. in the eleven months ending November 30, 1859,
exceeded 10,000,000 cwt. in the eleven months ending November
30, 1860.</p>

<p>I need not call your Majesty’s attention to the vast increase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</span>
in the imports of grain, or to the remarkable increase in the
exports of manufactures, or to the greatly extended consumption
of coal at remote stations. In a word, while the bulky articles
which require ships for their conveyance to distant parts of the
world have enormously increased, the shipping of the world has
been comparatively stationary during the past year, and the
many losses and disasters at sea during 1860 have tended materially
to diminish the already scanty supply of shipping necessary
to conduct the oversea trade of the world. All this will,
without doubt, right itself in time, but it will take one year, if
not two years, to do so. In the mean time, it might so happen
that the artisans of France may be thrown out of employment
for the want of French ships to bring them those raw materials
necessary to keep them employed; or, what will amount to
nearly the same, the increased cost to the manufacturer of the
raw material, through the laws of France compelling him to
bring it in her ships, might be so great that he would be unable
to compete in price with his rivals in other countries, and, consequently,
be obliged to close his mills or his workshops, as the
case might be, for want of remunerative employment.</p>

<p>Might I, therefore, venture to impress upon your Majesty the
desirability, I may even say the necessity, of at least placing the
carrying-trade between France and the possessions of Great
Britain on the same footing as it now exists between the mother
countries. Your people would be immense gainers by this
change, and your Shipowners would not suffer, for, independent
altogether of the facts which I have stated in regard to the
advantages which they, as carriers, derive above all others
from the policy of Free-trade, there will be for the next twelve
months at least ample employment for the shipping of all
nations. I cannot close this, I fear too lengthy a letter, without
calling to your Majesty’s attention a remarkable instance of the
injury which even the Shipowners of that great maritime
country, the United States, sustain by protection. While in
1856, 1857, and 1858, the tonnage owned in England increased
335,000 tons, the tonnage of America in those same years actually
decreased 67,000 tons.</p>

<p>In a recent visit which I made to that country, I did not fail,
in the many opportunities afforded me, to impress upon its Shipowners
that they were more interested in the removal of all
barriers to free intercourse than any other class of the community;
for, as those barriers which they still maintain along their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</span>
coast retard their commerce, and consequently limit the exchange
of the different articles produced in the various districts, the
employment of their vessels must necessarily be more curtailed
than it would otherwise be if greater facilities were afforded for
the transmission of those articles which one district produces in
greater abundance than another.</p>

<p>To those maritime questions I have long devoted my attention,
and I have often been struck at the circuitous course which ships,
by the laws which nations adopted, have been obliged to follow.
The ocean was meant to be free to mankind, but one nation by
its laws dictates the course which the ships of other nations
must follow; another nation, by way of retaliation, lays down
the only course which it will allow its competitors to adopt.
Thus we see ships, for instance, allowed to follow one track with
cargo, but compelled to return by the same track, in ballast.
We see the wool which your own people require, instead of being
imported, as it ought to be, direct from Australia to the ports
of France, sent, by the Navigation Laws of France, to the ports of
England, and from thence imported at greatly enhanced prices
to the consumers. It is the same with the produce of India.
Those lines of steamers belonging to England, which run weekly
from Calcutta and Bombay, and all the great ports of the East
to Great Britain, passing Marseilles and the other seaports of
France, are not allowed to land, for the use of its people, the
very articles of which they may be in urgent want. All experience
has proved that while those restrictions do great injury
to the commerce of all nations, they inflict the largest amount
of injury upon the people of the nation that imposes them.</p>

<p>The feeble efforts of so humble an individual as myself, may
be of little avail in the removal of those pernicious restrictions,
but I will never cease those efforts till the ocean, which was
meant for the use of mankind in general, is as free as the waves
which roll over it, and the gale which hurries them along. And
if your Majesty would grant me your powerful aid by making
one step in the direction I have so imperfectly ventured to point
out, I feel that other nations will follow the example of a
Sovereign so enlightened and so exalted, and thus I may live to
see the object I have so anxiously in view crowned with
success.</p>

Londres, 17th June, 1862.<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>The ‘Moniteur’ of the 2nd of May last published a report
submitted to the Emperor by the Minister of Agriculture, Commerce,
and Public Works, relative to the state of the French
mercantile marine and the law by which it is governed.</p>

<p>In conformity with the suggestion of this report, which has
been approved by his Majesty, the <i>Conseil Supérieur</i> of Commerce
is instructed to prosecute an inquiry for the purpose of furnishing
the Imperial Government with the data which it needs in
order to enable it to judge between the diversity of opinion
which has arisen on this grave question.</p>

<p>In the inquiry, as in that which has been presented on the
reform of our Customs legislation, it will be advantageous that
the principal maritime places in Foreign States should be
represented, and the statements of their representatives heard
side by side with those of French merchants and Shipowners.
This is why the Minister of Foreign Affairs invites me to inform
those principally interested here that the <i>Conseil Supérieur</i> will
begin its sittings about the 10th of next month.</p>

<p>M. Thouvenel adds that in case, as he hopes, the merchants
of London, appreciating the importance of the questions to be
raised in this inquiry, will express their intention to respond
to the invitation of the French Ministry, I should communicate
their names to him, so that he may invite them to present
themselves at the Ministry of Agriculture, Commerce, and Public
Works, Department of Foreign Commerce, Rue de Tarennes 78b.
M. Rouher will take the necessary measures that they may be
summoned before the Upper Council with all due promptitude.</p>

<p>I think, Sir, I cannot do better than communicate this invitation
to you, requesting you to inform me whether it will be
agreeable to you to accede to it yourself. I shall, moreover,
be much obliged by your communicating with the merchants or
Shipowners in the City, and forwarding to me the names of such
as may wish to take advantage of it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</span>
I shall take care to let you know later the precise date when
the sittings of the Council will open.</p>

8, Austin Friars, London, 23rd June, 1862.<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>I have read with no ordinary interest the letter you did me
the honour to address me on the 17th instant, and I shall be
happy to forward the object your Government has in view by
every means in my power. So far as I am concerned, you have
merely to name the time when my presence is again required
in Paris. In regard to other witnesses, the publication of your
letter to me would enable you to obtain a greater amount and
variety of evidence than could possibly be obtained through my
own unaided exertions. I am glad your Government has
decided upon an open inquiry, for thus all the important facts
bearing upon the subject can be brought to light. The knowledge
of these facts will greatly facilitate the inquiry about to
be instituted. For instance, I dare say your Shipowners think (as
our Shipowners thought in 1849) that any material relaxation
of the Navigation Laws of France would ruin them. The arguments
used against the repeal of our laws in 1849 were very
plausible, but not very profound; for what are the facts? The
repeal of our Navigation Laws came into operation on the 1st
January, 1850; the aggregate tonnage of the merchant navy of
the British empire at that time was 4,232,962 tons. It had risen
from 2,681,276 tons in 1815. So that the increase, under the
guardian care of the State, had in the previous thirty-five years
been 1,551,686 tons. That increase was then considered very
great; and, as we could not look into futurity, much stress was
laid upon the argument that if protection were removed from
British shipping, any increase would in future be monopolised
by the ships of foreign nations. But the Legislature had other
interests to consider besides that to which I belong. Protection
was, therefore, swept away, and Shipowners were left to depend
upon their own exertions, instead of depending upon the State.
Their desponding was great, but so far from being “ruined,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</span>
they are richer now than ever they were at any former period,
if I may judge of their wealth by the extraordinary increase of
our shipping. On the 1st January, 1860 (ten years after all
protection had been removed), we owned 5,710,968 tons. Thus,
in ten years of Free-trade our increase was about as great as it
had been in thirty-five years of protection; but the increase in
the amount of business carried on in British ships is even more
remarkable. Here are the facts:</p>

<p>In 1842, there were entered and cleared at our ports of British
shipping 6,669,995 tons; 1850, 9,442,544 tons; 1861, 15,420,532
tons; the increase being 2,772,549 tons during nine years of protection,
and 5,977,988 tons during eleven years of Free-trade.</p>

<p>In 1812 we built 129,929 tons of shipping; in 1849 only
117,953 tons. In 1850, we built 133,695 tons, and in 1861,
310,900 tons; showing an annual decrease between the former
periods of 11,976 tons, but an annual increase between the latter
of 177,205 tons.</p>

<p>The reason of these extraordinary results is obvious. Shipping
is not the parent, it is the child of commerce. If your
Government apply to its merchant shipping the principles we
have adopted, you will find that the results will be very much
the same, for these principles are applicable to all countries.
Shipping has no creative power in itself, like land, or manufactures,
or minerals; it depends, entirely, upon other interests
for its existence. If a country produced what was necessary
for its own wants and no more, it would not require any ships.
If France had no commerce with other countries, and no trade
along its own shores, there would be no employment for its
shipping in its own trade. Now, though France has, I daresay,
within herself the means of producing what other nations require
to nearly as great an extent as the United Kingdom, and, though
she requires as much or even more from other countries than
we do, yet her sea-borne commerce is very limited as compared
with her resources and her powers of consumption. Turning to
the ‘Tableau Général du Commerce de la France,’ I find that,
in 1860, the entrances and clearances with cargoes only in your
foreign and colonial trades, and the entrances in your coasting
trade, including the ships of France and of every nation trading
with her, amounted to 9,773,865 tons, whereas, in the same year,
it required 37,841,329 tons of shipping to transport the cargoes
which entered and cleared from the ports of the United Kingdom.
But, curiously enough, though the ships of all nations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</span>
are allowed to enter our ports (and our consumers invite them
to do so), there was, in 1860, in our foreign trade, only 4,294,444
tons of foreign shipping with cargoes as against 5,760,537
tons of British shipping; whereas, in your foreign trade, in the
same year, there was 2,348,261 tons of foreign shipping with
cargoes as against 1,663,615 tons of your own.</p>

<p>It is, thus, evident that any restriction you impose on the
freedom of intercourse with other countries, while it curtails
the operations of your merchants, likewise enhances the price
of the raw material to your manufacturers; and while it
increases the cost of the commodity to your people, curtails the
employment of your Shipowners. But, even if those restrictions
and differential duties (which you still maintain without any
advantage to the revenue) benefited your Shipowners, which
they do not, why should your merchants and manufacturers, and
landowners and farmers, and, above all, your hardworking
people, be made to suffer, so that your Shipowners might be
enriched? So long as all the producing classes were protected,
the Shipowners might have had some right to say that, as they
were obliged to pay, for the benefit, real or imaginary of others,
enhanced prices for all articles of consumption, they were consequently
entitled to some compensating protection; but, since
the recent relaxations of the French tariff, and, now that the
producing classes are exposed to the competition of other countries,
these classes have unquestionably a right to insist on
free navigation.</p>

<p>No doubt your Shipowners will consider, as ours did, that
their class was entitled to claim peculiar privileges, because the
merchant service is the legitimate nursery of the seamen for the
navy necessary for the protection of the State; but we have
20,000 more seamen now in our merchant service than we had
in 1849. Free intercourse with other countries gave increased
employment to our shipping, and therefore we required more
seamen. So it will be with your country when you adopt a
similar policy.</p>

<p>But, however fallacious the arguments have proved which were
used against the repeal of our Navigation Laws, it is hardly
possible to conceive anything so pernicious and absurd as the
law itself which you still maintain. By way of illustration,
may I direct your attention to the line of steamers trading
between Southampton and the various ports in India, <i>viâ</i> the
Mediterranean? These vessels pass Marseilles every week laden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</span>
with articles of which your people may be greatly in want, but
the differential duties which the laws of France levy are so high
on these articles (because they happen to be in English ships)
that they cannot be landed, consequently they are carried
through the Straits of Gibraltar, and across the Bay of Biscay
to Southampton, and from thence by rail to London, and there
shipped in either English or French bottoms to some port in
France. Could anything be more absurd? The price your
people pay for this folly is well illustrated by the startling fact
that in 1860 France imported from the United Kingdom
8,000,000 lbs. of silk, 4,000,000 lbs. of coffee, 16,000,000 lbs. of
wool, and 116,000 cwt. of cotton, not an ounce of any of these
articles having been produced in this country.</p>

<p>For the protection and “benefit” of your Shipowners, which
is purely imaginary, as I will show, your people were compelled
to pay greatly enhanced prices upon an enormous quantity
of articles necessary for their existence.</p>

<p>A few facts will now suffice to prove that your Shipowners
have not profited by protection any more than our Shipowners
when they were under the guardian care of the State.</p>

<p>Your coasting trade is confined strictly to French vessels.
The vessels of all other nations are actually prohibited from
entering it. In that trade there were entered and cleared in
1850, 2,447,556 tons of shipping. In 1860, 2,917,823 tons were
entered and cleared. In your trade with the United Kingdom
your Shipowners have had to contend on equal terms with the
owners of British shipping, yet what are the results? In 1850
there were entered and cleared in that trade 594,640 tons of
French shipping, cargoes, and ballast, but in 1860 the entrances
and clearances of your own shipping in the same trade had
increased to 1,017,617 tons. Thus, while the vessels in your
closely protected trade increased 20 per cent., those engaged in
the unprotected trade were nearly doubled!</p>

<p>I fear I weary you with figures, but allow me to give one
more instance of the pernicious effects of a protective policy on
both English and French shipping, as shown by a return of the
tonnage of ships built for or otherwise added to the merchant
navies of the United Kingdom and France in the following
years. (<i>See</i> Table, p. 595.)</p>

<p>These figures speak for themselves. The comparative annual
progress of the shipping of both countries was not worthy of
notice during the first period, when both were protected by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</span>
laws of the respective countries. You made a start when
between 1849 and 1850 our Navigation Laws were repealed, but
when the impetus which that repeal gave to our commerce came
into play, and when our Shipowners felt that they had to depend
upon themselves, and not upon the State, we shot ahead at an
amazing rate during the second period, while the annual increase
of your shipping remained stationary.</p>

<p>When in Paris last month, I had occasion to converse with
many of your merchants and others in regard to the effect produced
by the recent commercial treaty. They were satisfied, but
they felt that something more was wanted, though they could not
exactly say what it was. Now, though both countries have every
reason to be much satisfied with that treaty, the want is to me very
apparent. Free navigation must accompany freedom of commerce.
The ramifications of commerce are so numerous and the
competition so close that the slightest hindrance to its natural
flow, or the smallest increase of freight, either retards, paralyses,
or destroys vast branches of it. The trade which your people
are now carrying on with England and its colonies and possessions
is greatly retarded by the restrictions of the Navigation
Laws. The produce of France which we buy is not in all cases
paid for by the produce or manufactures of this country. We wish
you to take in exchange for your wines and for the other productions
of France which we require, and you desire in many cases
to receive in payment for those productions, the produce of our
colonies and possessions; but your Navigation Laws raise, as I
have shown, the price of all such importations, so as to affect,
most unfavourably for your people, the conditions of exchange,
and, consequently, our commercial intercourse with each other is
much more limited than it would be under a system of free
navigation. I most sincerely trust that these restrictions may
soon be removed; I do so, not merely on account of my countrymen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</span>
but for the benefit of your people, who will be large gainers
by the change.</p>

<p>We were the first nation, I regret to say, to raise barriers to
free intercourse with other nations. It was Great Britain which
first set up laws to dictate the course which the ships of other
nations should follow upon the ocean meant to be free for the use
of mankind.</p>

<p>We maintained that wretched policy for centuries to the injury
of others, but not to our own gain.</p>

<p>At last we discovered that the poverty of our neighbours did
not enrich ourselves. Twelve years ago we changed our policy,
and I have given you an outline of the happy results. Your
country is still pursuing the same mistaken policy, but I think
the day is not far distant when your enlightened Monarch will
sweep away all the ancient barriers which hamper his commerce,
and thus give to his people that freedom of intercourse
which, while it tends to promote peace and goodwill, cannot fail
to develop to an extent hitherto unknown the vast natural
resources of your country.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Letter to the Commercial Association, Lisbon.</i></p>


<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 1em;">Braganza Hotel, Lisbon,</span><br>
28th January, 1863.<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>My engagements have been such that it has not been in
my power till now to answer your letter of the 20th instant.
I have, however, in the interval been endeavouring to obtain
statistical information in regard to the amount of tonnage belonging
to this country, and the entrances and clearances of
ships at its ports. I have obtained that information so far as
regards the commerce of Lisbon and Oporto, but I cannot find
that any returns are published of the general commerce of Portugal
or of its shipping. I am therefore unable to offer an
opinion to the members of your association respecting the effect
produced upon your shipping, and on the sea-borne commerce,
by your navigation and commercial laws. The trade of Lisbon,
however, so far as the entries inwards and outwards are concerned,
shows little or no increase these last six years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</span></p>

<p>Considering the geographical position of Portugal and its
natural resources, you seem to have more to gain by free intercourse
with other nations than most other countries. The
magnificent Tagus offers facilities which few harbours in Europe
possess. Yet, with these great natural advantages, you do not
appear to be doing one-half the amount of trade you might do,
and I believe this arises in a great measure from the restrictive
nature of your Navigation Laws, and the cumbrous, slow, and
harassing character of your Customs’ regulations.</p>

<p>England maintained somewhat similar Navigation Laws up to
1869. At that time the aggregate tonnage of the merchant
navy of the British Empire was 4,232,962 tons. It had risen
from 2,681,276 tons in 1815, showing an increase of 1,551,686 tons
in thirty-five years of Protection, and it was, therefore, argued
by many persons that the repeal of those laws, while it would
benefit the Shipowners of other nations, would be suicidal to
our own. But our leading statesmen were of a very different
opinion. They felt that it was for the interest of the people of
Great Britain to have the freest possible intercourse with all
nations; to import what they required, and export what they
had to sell at the lowest cost; and, as shipping is not the parent
but merely the child of commerce, they foresaw that it must
increase with the increased intercourse with other nations. The
result has proved the wisdom of their opinions. A reference
to our Board of Trade returns (a copy of which I will send
to you on my return to England) shows the enormous increase of
our commerce, and the consequent increase of the wealth and
prosperity of our people.</p>

<p>Since the 1st of January, 1850, ships of all nations have been
allowed to enter and leave our ports, and to trade to our colonies
and possessions on the same terms in all respects as our own
vessels. And while our people have been large gainers by the
repeal of the Navigation Laws, an Act which that year came into
operation, our Shipowners have been greatly benefited, for in 1860
we owned 5,710,968 tons of shipping, showing an increase in ten
years of Free-trade nearly as great as the increase during thirty-five
years of Protection.</p>

<p>But the increase in the amount of business carried on in
British ships to and from the ports of Great Britain is even more
remarkable.</p>

<p>In 1842 there were entered and cleared at our ports of British
shipping, 6,669,995 tons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</span></p>

<p>In 1850 there were entered and cleared at our ports of British
shipping, 9,442,544 tons.</p>

<p>In 1861 there were entered and cleared at our ports of British
shipping, 15,420,532 tons.</p>

<p>The increase being 2,772,549 tons during nine years of Protection,
while it was no less than 5,977,988 tons during eleven
years of Free-trade.</p>

<p>But experience has proved that restrictive laws are injurious
to all countries which maintain them. It is verified in your
our own case. See what the trade of the Tagus has become to
that of the Thames or Mersey, though the former affords much
greater natural facilities for shipping and commerce. It has
long been apparent in Spain; and though the wealth and great
natural resources of that country are now in course of development
by means of railway communication, its intercourse with
other countries is still very limited, and must remain so while
they continue to maintain high differential duties, which yield
little or no revenue, and seriously curtail their intercourse with
the world.</p>

<p>Even France is a striking example of the loss a nation sustains
by endeavouring by means of Protection to shut herself up
within herself.</p>

<p>It is thus evident that every restriction a country imposes
upon its freedom of intercourse with other countries—while it
curtails the operations of its merchants, and enhances the price
of the raw material to its manufacturers, increasing also the
cost of the commodity to the people—must necessarily curtail
the employment of its Shipowners.</p>

<p>These restrictive laws often compel merchants to buy what
they require, at greatly enhanced prices, articles not produced in
the country from whence they are imported; as is the case in
your importations from England of cotton, sugar, coffee, hemp,
jute, silk, foreign wool, and numerous other articles, all arising
in a great measure from the fact that the differential duties<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
imposed by your Navigation Laws oblige you to import foreign
manufactures or produce, either in your own ships or in the
ships of the country where the articles were produced. Consequently
the people of Portugal pay much higher prices than we
do for almost every article they require to import from other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</span>countries, for the exclusive benefit of your Shipowners, who do
not increase the number of their vessels. But these restrictive
laws retard the natural progress of commerce in ways too
numerous to mention within the limits of a letter, and they are
as absurd as they are pernicious. Their absurdity becomes
apparent when you ask yourself the question, why should the
merchants of either France or Portugal not be allowed, when it
suits their purpose, to import direct, in any ships they please,
the produce of Europe, Asia, Africa, or America, instead of importing
it through England or through any other country where
it is <i>not</i> grown?</p>

<p>France, as you are aware, has recently made great changes in
her commercial tariff, and ere long she will, I daresay, make as
great changes in her Navigation Laws. I can offer no opinion
to your Chamber of Commerce beyond advising its members in
the interests of their country to urge the Legislature by petitions
and by every constitutional means within their power <i>to remove
every restriction in your Customs’ regulations not absolutely necessary for
the protection of the revenue, to reduce the duties upon all articles of
large consumption, to abolish all differential duties which yield little or
no revenue, and to repeal your Navigation Laws, which do the people
great injury, and do not benefit your Shipowners except in rare
instances</i>.</p>

<p>I am thoroughly convinced that by some such changes as these
much of your ancient greatness and grandeur would be restored.
Unwise laws, combined with other matters too delicate for me
to name, have done perhaps more to retard your progress than
the loss of your possessions in the East, or your severance from
the Brazils. Indeed, had Portugal adopted Free-trade measures
at the time of that severance she would have retained the bulk
of the Brazilian commerce; but your Protection laws set up
barriers at all your ports, through which very few ships but
your own could enter—they drove trade from your cities, and
the very bread from the mouths of your children. No wonder
that the glory of Portugal passed away; and that your merchants,
who were, indeed, princes in the days of Vasco de Gama, are now
almost unknown in the markets of Europe.</p>

<p>Even, in spite of your restrictive laws, the natural facilities of
the Tagus are still so great and so many that vessels from the
Brazils are beginning to make it their port of call, and if the
changes I have ventured to name are carried into effect, I am
certain that Lisbon, from its position, is destined to carry on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</span>
very extensive traffic with the world. It may even become one
of the great entrepôts for the supply of many of the European
markets, as the railways now in course of construction will
afford facilities for conveying its imports, not merely to the
interior of Portugal and to Spain, but also to more distant
parts of Europe.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, sad to look, as I now do, from the window of my
hotel upon the beautiful but lifeless Tagus—to think what it <i>is</i>
by nature, what it <i>was</i> in commerce, and what it might be under
wise and liberal laws. The future is in the hands of your
own people, and the members of your chamber might become
instruments of great good by the dissemination of statistical and
other information bearing upon the questions on which you have
invited my opinion. You have happily a free press, which will
enable your chamber to do so to great advantage. I return to
England to-morrow. When I reach home I shall forward to
you copies of the works you desire to possess, as also other
publications which may be of service to you. Much useful
information might also be obtained from the various ministers
and consuls resident in this city; and I am sure they will only
be too happy to assist you in the laudable object you have in
view, for the countries they represent, especially England and
France, are deeply interested in every measure tending to create
greater intercourse between your country and their own.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Appendix7">APPENDIX No. 7.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Summary of the Acts passed for the Regulation of Passenger Ships.</i></p>

<p>The first separate Act for regulating passenger ships was the
43 Geo. 3, cap. 56. By this Act the number of passengers to be
carried in any British vessel was limited to one person, including
the crew, for every two tons of the unladen part of the
ship, and in foreign ships two persons for every five tons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</span>
Vessels to North America were required to be victualled for
twelve weeks, so as to afford a daily allowance for each person
of ½ lb. of meat, 1½ lb. of biscuit or oatmeal, with ½ pint of
molasses, and 1 gallon of water. Regulations were prescribed
for mustering the passengers and for promoting cleanliness on
the voyage, and a surgeon was to be carried. The master and
surgeon were obliged to give bond in the sum of 100<i>l.</i> severally
to keep a true journal, which journal was, on the return of the
vessel, to be delivered to the officer of Customs and verified on
oath. Bond was likewise to be given by the owners or master
for the seaworthiness of the ship and the delivery of the
passengers at their destined ports. An abstract of the Act was
to be hung up on board.</p>

<p>Some slight amendments of detail were made in this law in
1813 by the 53 Geo. 3, cap. 36; and in the year 1816 it was
further amended by the Act 56 Geo. 3, caps. 83, 114. By the
first of these Acts, which is confined in its operation to Newfoundland
and the coast of Labrador, the tonnage check was
omitted, and the limitation was changed to the check by space,
viz. 6 feet in length by 2 feet in breadth for each passenger,
with the full perpendicular height between the two decks in
vessels having two decks, and 5 feet perpendicular between the
cargo and deck when there was no second deck.</p>

<p>The dietary scale was increased to</p>

<p>but the allowance of water was reduced from 8 to 5 pints.</p>

<div class="sidenote">57 Geo. 3.
c. 10; 1817.</div>

<p>In 1817 the original Act (43 Geo. 3, cap. 56), which had been
previously repealed in respect of Newfoundland and Labrador,
was repealed in respect of the rest of British North America by
the 57 Geo. 3, cap. 10. By this Act the number of passengers
was limited to one passenger for every 2½ tons burthen—and in
ships partly laden with goods, in the same proportion for the
unladen portion only. A distinction in computation was, for
the first time, made between children and adults; three children
under fourteen being reckoned, for space purposes, as one adult.
The dietary was the same as in the repealed Act of 56 Geo. 3,
cap. 83. The Shipowner was to give bond for the number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</span>
passengers on board, and for their being landed at the proper
port. An abstract of the Act was to be hung up on board.</p>

84; 1823.</div>

<div class="sidenote">6 Geo. 4, c.
116; 1825.</div>

<p>In 1823 the preceding Acts were repealed, and their principal
provisions embodied in the 4 Geo. 4, cap. 84, which enacted that
vessels should not carry to any place out of Europe more than
one person, including master and crew, for every 5 tons, without
special permission or licence from the Commissioners of Customs.
The licence would only be granted, in the case of British ships,
to vessels having two decks, with 5 feet 6 inches in height
between them. Vessels carrying goods were permitted to take
passengers in the proportion of one adult to every 2 tons of
unladen space, provided that to each passenger there should be
allotted an “integral” space of 6 feet in length by 2 feet 6 inches
in breadth, and 5 feet 6 inches in height between the decks, or
from cargo to deck, when there was no second deck. Two children
under fourteen, or three under seven, were to be computed as
one adult. Bond was to be given in the sum of 20<i>l.</i> for each
passenger, that the vessel was seaworthy and properly stored
with water and provisions, and provided with a surgeon, in
case there were fifty persons, including the crew, on board.
Passengers could only be embarked at a Custom-house port. A
penalty of 50<i>l.</i> was imposed for each passenger in excess of the
licence. The allowance of provisions, &amp;c., was—</p>

&amp;c. Rules for cleanliness and fumigation were established;
ships carrying passengers were to be marked with a “P.” if
there were more than one person, including the crew, to every
5 tons on board. The Act did not apply to vessels engaged in
the Newfoundland fishery. The Commissioners of Customs at
home, the local authorities in the colonies, and the officers of the
navy and consuls abroad were to execute the Act. This law
having been repealed in 1825 by an Act to repeal the several
laws relating to the customs, was re-enacted the same year with
some slight modifications by the 6 Geo. 4, cap. 116.</p>

<p>The total absence of any legislative regulations having led to

necessary limitations in the passenger trade. This Act was
restricted in its operation to the continent and islands of North
America. The limit upon the numbers to be carried was three
persons for every 4 tons burthen. Ships carrying passengers
were to have a height of 5½ feet between the decks or between
the platform and the deck. Two children under fourteen, or
three between one and seven, were to be computed as one adult.
Fifty gallons of water and 50 lbs. of bread, biscuit, or oatmeal,
were to be put on board for each passenger. Provisions, water,
or stores were not to be carried on that part of the ’tween decks
appropriated to the emigrants. Passengers were not to be
landed at the places not contracted for, and the masters were to
enter into bond for the due performance of the regulations
prescribed by the Act.</p>

<p>By the 5 &amp; 6 Will. 4, cap. 53, the Act of 1828 was repealed,
and further provisions made for the regulation of the carriage of
passengers. No ship was allowed to sail with more than three
persons for every 5 tons of burthen, and was required to have
a height of 5½ feet between decks, and for every passenger
carried 10 clear superficial feet of space on the lower deck or
platform. Ships having two tiers of berths were to have 6 inches
between the bottom of the lower berths and the deck. The
quantity of water and provisions to be put on board was 5
gallons of water, 7 lbs. of bread, biscuit, or oatmeal, or bread-stuffs,
for each passenger per week, the length of the voyage
being computed as follows, viz.:—</p>

at which provisions were to be sold on board to the passengers.
The seaworthiness of the ship was to be ascertained by survey.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</span>
Copies or abstracts of the Act were to be kept on board. Ships
carrying 100 passengers were to carry a medical man, duly
authorised by law to practise in this country as a physician,
surgeon, or apothecary, and a proper supply of instruments,
medicines, &amp;c.; and ships carrying less than 100 passengers
were to have a proper supply of medicines and other things
adequate to the probable exigencies of the voyage. Passenger
ships were prohibited from carrying spirits as stores in larger
quantities than 10 per cent. more than the quantity allowed by
the Customs for the use of the crew. Lists of passengers, with
their names, ages, and occupations, were to be made out and
delivered to the chief officer of Customs. Passengers were not
to be landed at ports not contracted for without their consent.
Two children under fourteen, or three between one and seven,
were to be reckoned as an adult. Infants under twelve months
were not to be counted. The passengers were to be victualled,
or receive each a shilling a day in lieu thereof, for every day
they were detained before the sailing of the ship, provided the
detention did not arise from stress of weather, or other unavoidable
cause; they were also entitled to remain on board forty-eight
hours after the arrival of the ship, except where the ship
proceeded to another port, in prosecution of her voyage.
Masters were to give bond for the due performance of the regulations
prescribed by the Act.</p>

be more than two tiers of berths; the bottom of the lower tier
to be 6 inches above the deck; the berths were not to be less

<p>The provisions and water were to be inspected and surveyed
by the Government emigration agents, or in their absence by
the officer of Customs. Seaworthiness of vessels was to be ascertained
by those officers, who might order a survey if
necessary. Boats were to be taken in the following numbers,
viz.:—</p>

<p>Ships between 150 and 250 tons, two boats.</p>

<p>Ships between 250 and 500 tons, three boats.</p>

<p>Ships of 500 tons and upwards, four boats; one of them to be
a long-boat, of the proper size.</p>

<p>Copies of the Act were to be kept on board, to be produced to
the passengers on demand. A proper supply of medicines, &amp;c.,
with directions for their use, was to be provided for the voyage
to North America; and on other voyages, ships carrying 100
passengers, or fifty, if the voyage were longer than twelve
weeks, were also required to have on board a duly-qualified
medical practitioner. The sale of spirits to the passengers was
prohibited. Parties contracting to find passages to North
America were to give written receipts for moneys received
in a prescribed form. No person, except owner or master of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</span>
the ship, was allowed to act as a passage-broker, unless licensed
by the magistrates at the petty or quarter sessions. In case the
contract for a passage were not performed, the aggrieved parties,
unless maintained at the contractor’s expense, and provided
within a reasonable time with a passage to the same place,
might recover any passage-money they had paid, with a sum
not exceeding 10<i>l.</i> as compensation. Passengers were to be
victualled during detention of ships; but if detention (except
caused by wind or weather) exceeded two clear working days,
they were to receive instead 1<i>s.</i> per diem, unless suitably lodged
and maintained with their own consent by the contractor.
Passengers were not to be landed against their consent at any
place other than the one contracted for, and were to be maintained
on board for forty-eight hours after arrival, unless the
ship, in the prosecution of her voyage, quitted the port sooner.
The Act extended to foreign as well as to British ships, but not
to vessels carrying fewer than thirty passengers, nor to cabin
passengers. The enforcement of the law rested with the Government
emigration agents and officers of Customs.</p>

<p>The 5 &amp; 6 Vict. cap. 107, was amended by the 10 &amp; 11 Vict.
cap. 103, and 11 Vict. cap. 6. The first of these Acts brought
within the full operation of the law such ships as carried more
than one passenger for every twenty-five tons of registered
burthen. It gave power to the Commissioners to vary the diet.
It prohibited the carriage of gunpowder, vitriol, or green hides
as cargo. It gave power to ensure ventilation between decks, a
survey of the ship, and a proper crew. Ships putting back
were to replenish their provisions. In case of wreck, or other
accident, the passengers were to be provided with a passage in
some other vessel. The second amending Act, which was confined
to North America, required that a ship carrying more than
100 passengers, should have a cook and proper cooking apparatus;
and if she did not carry a medical practitioner, that the
superficial space for each passenger should be 14 instead of
12 feet. Passengers were to be examined by a medical practitioner,
and persons affected with contagious or other disease
likely to affect the health of the other passengers were not
allowed to proceed. The passage-money of persons re-landed
was made recoverable from the ship. The Queen in Council
was empowered to issue rules and regulations for the preservation
of order on board. Ships carrying fewer passengers than
one to twenty five tons were exempted from the Act.</p>

<p>By an Act passed in June, 1852, the two previous Acts of
1849 and 1851 were repealed, but their provisions were re-enacted
in a consolidated and amended form, with some alterations
and additions. The following are the main differences
introduced by the Act of 1852: It empowered the Emigration
Commissioners to sue and be sued, by their secretary or one
of themselves, and exempted them from personal liability in
respect of all acts done in their official capacity. It forfeited
“passenger ships” putting to sea without obtaining a clearing
certificate from an emigration officer; it required ships taking
additional passengers at outports to obtain a fresh clearance
from the emigration officer; it punished, by fine or imprisonment,
stowaways and their abettors; it required the survey of
ships to be undertaken by <i>two</i> (instead of one, as in the previous
Act) or more surveyors, and provided for an appeal against
their decision; it required that single men should be berthed
in a separate compartment in the fore-part of the ship; it provided
for hospital accommodation and privies; it extended the
boat scale, and required night-signals and fire-engines to be
carried; it added to the articles expressly prohibited as cargo—horses,
cattle, and lucifer-matches—and prohibited the carriage
of cargo on passenger decks, unless stowed so as not to interfere
with light and ventilation or the comfort of the emigrants. It
fixed different lengths of voyage for steam- and sailing-vessels,
and increased, from seventy to eighty days, the length of voyage
to North America for ships sailing between the middle of
October and the middle of January; in other respects, the
prescribed length of voyage remained substantially the same as
in the Act of 1852. It required that the provisions of the crew
should not be inferior to those of the passengers, and empowered
the emigration officers to reject bad provisions. The dietary
scale (with the exception of substituting a small allowance of
salt for molasses) was the same as in the Act of 1849, but a
greater variety of articles was allowed to be substituted for
oatmeal, rice, and potatoes. It required the provisions to be
issued in a cooked state, and daily instead of twice a-week, as in
the Act of 1849. It provided for the appointment of passengers’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</span>
stewards, and interpreters when required, and for the medical
inspection of the crew as well as of the passengers. It extended,
from forty-eight hours to ten days, the time within
which a Shipowner may forward passengers who had not
obtained passages in the ships for which they contracted. It
required masters of ships putting back for the purpose of repairing
damages, to maintain the passengers, or pay them subsistence
money, until the ship is ready for sea or they are
provided with passages in some other eligible ship. It further
empowered the Secretary of State, Governor of a Colony, or
British Consul, to defray the expenses of rescuing, and—if the
master fails to do so—forwarding shipwrecked passengers, and
constitutes such expenses a debt to the Crown, to be recovered
from the owner, charterer, or master of the ship. The prohibition
against acting as a passage-broker without a licence, which
was formerly restricted to passages to North America, was now
extended to passages to any place out of Europe, not being in
the Mediterranean; and the amount of the passage-broker’s
annual bond was increased from 200<i>l.</i> to 500<i>l.</i> It empowered
trustees of docks to pass bye-laws for regulating the landing
and embarking of emigrants, and for licensing emigrant runners—who
were for the first time brought under legal control
by being compelled to take out an annual licence, and to wear a
badge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18 &amp; 19
Vict. c.

<p>The Act of 1852 was repealed and amended by the Act of
1855, which is the chief Act now in force. It is in the main
similar to the previous Act, but contains several additions,
which are fully shown in the preceding memorandum. The
principal of them relate—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. To the reduction of the number of passengers required to
bring a ship within the operation of the Act.</p>

<p>2. To the reduction of the age of a “statute adult” from 14
to 12 years.</p>

<p>3. To the distinction between the upper and lower passenger
deck.</p>

<p>4. To the increase of space allowed to passengers.</p>

<p>5. To certificates of exemption for mail steamers.</p>

<p>6. To appeals from the decision of an emigration officer who
may decline to grant a clearing certificate.</p>

<p>7. To the stowage of cargo.</p>

<p>8. To the dietary scale for Australian voyages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</span></p>

<p>9. To the increase in the amount of detention money.</p>

<p>10. To the rights of passengers in case of the wreck or destruction
of a passenger ship before the commencement of the
voyage.</p>

<p>11. To contract tickets for cabin passengers in “passenger
ships,” and a summary remedy before magistrates for enforcing
the contract.</p>

<p>12. To emigrant runners.</p>

<p>13. To agents of licensed passage brokers.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">26 &amp; 27
Vict. c. 51;
1863.</div>

<p>The material alterations introduced into the Act of 1855 by
the amending Act of 1863 may be classed under the seven
following heads:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The number of passengers necessary to bring a ship within
the operation of the law is increased from two to three <i>statute
adults</i> for every 100 tons, and from 30 to 50 <i>passengers</i> in all.</p>

<p>2. The exemption heretofore enjoyed by certain mail steamers
is withdrawn.</p>

<p>3. The tonnage check on the number of passengers to be
carried is abolished, leaving the space check only to operate.</p>

<p>4. Cabin passengers are to be included in the lists to be furnished
to the officers of Customs, and such passengers are now
entitled to a return of half their passage money in case they are
prevented by an emigration officer from undertaking their
voyage on account of the state of their health.</p>

<p>5. Under certain restrictions the carriage of a limited number
of horses, cattle, and dogs in passenger ships is allowed.</p>

<p>6. In case of wreck or damage to the ship the same regulations
are extended to passengers whose passages have been provided
for them by others, as were applicable under the Act of
1855 to passengers who had contracted for their own passages.</p>

<p>7. The bond to be given by the master and another surety to
the Crown is increased from 200<i>l.</i> to 500<i>l.</i> in the case of ships of
which neither the owner nor charterers reside in the United
Kingdom, and the obligors are made liable for expenses incurred
in rescuing and forwarding shipwrecked passengers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Appendix12">APPENDIX No. 12.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Lloyd’s Register of British and Foreign Shipping.</i></p>

<p>Although no records have been preserved—what a mass of
knowledge must have been lost during the “dark ages”!—there
can be no doubt that from the earliest period, at least during
the plenitude of the Maritime Power of the Phœnicians, some
means must have been adopted to show that a ship was seaworthy,
and, as little doubt, that the relative qualities of ships,
in this respect, were classified, and, if not recorded in any public
documents, were, at least, well known to all persons interested in
shipping. However much the world may have changed, human
nature remains the same; and the merchants and Shipowners of
ancient times must have desired, as they do now, to know if
the vessel in which they embarked, or in which they shipped
their goods, was fit to carry them safely: from this desire would,
naturally, arise the competition of one Shipowner to have a better
vessel than his neighbour, so that he might secure a preference.
Nor can I suppose that this natural rivalry was confined, any
more then than it is now, to the superiority in strength of hull,
but was extended to equipment and speed. Indeed, that such
was the case is established by the unquestioned records handed
down to us of ancient vessels, including that in which St. Paul
made his celebrated voyage of which I have given an account
in the early portions of this work.</p>

<p>That the Italian Republics had some sort of classification
for their vessels we may feel even more certain, although, unfortunately,
throughout all time, no historians seem to have considered
shipping worthy of their pen—how strange, considering
the part it has played in the history of the world! for we find
that they went so far as to stipulate by law that no vessel should
be laden beyond a certain depth. It is, therefore, reasonable
to conclude that they had means of ascertaining the relative
qualities of vessels, and that records of these were kept and
made public for the guidance of underwriters, whom we know
then existed, and of all persons who required to entrust their
lives or goods in them. It would, therefore, be absurd to deny
the existence of institutions, till a very recent period, of some
sort or another which had for their object the classification
of ships, because no account of them has been written or
preserved.</p>

<p>I dare say the Ancient Britons knew, among themselves, perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</span>
well which of their ships were built of seasoned oak,
whether the planks were well put together, or fastened with
tree-nails or copper bolts, and how they were caulked, fitted,
and equipped. Nor is it at all unreasonable to suppose that
some sort of record of all these facts was kept for their guidance.
It would, indeed, be contrary to the instincts of human nature,
where self-interest has always prevailed, if no such notes were
taken and likewise recorded.</p>

<p>What particular form the earliest attempts at classification
took must be left entirely to conjecture, the first traces of the
existence of Register Books devoted specially to this purpose not
appearing until about the middle of the last century. The
oldest Register Books of which I have any knowledge are
those preserved at Lloyd’s Register of Shipping, White Lion
Court, Cornhill, and although the series is far from complete,
and probably can never be made complete, an examination
of them is both interesting and instructive. The earliest book
preserved there is dated 1764-5. In it the classes assigned
were denoted by the letters A, E, I, O, and U, which seem as
now to have applied to the state of the ship’s hull, and the
letters G, M, and B, appended, which applied to the equipment.
These latter denoted—G, good; M, middling; and B, bad. Thus,
A G denoted a first-class ship with a good equipment; and
U B denoted a ship of the lowest class with a bad equipment.</p>

<p>The next book, in point of age, here, is dated 1768-9, and,
instead of the capital letters A, E, I, O, U, denoting the class
of the ship, as in the earlier book, the small letters a, b, c,
appear, while the figures 1, 2 denoted the state of the equipment.
Thus, a 1 denoted a first-class ship with a first-class equipment;
b 2 denoted a second-class ship with a second-class equipment, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The next Register Book in point of age, preserved, is dated
1775, and, in this book, the Roman capitals appear again for the
hulls, while the figures 1 and 2 remain for the equipment.
This, as far as I can learn, is the earliest book preserved containing
the class A 1, which has become so familiar now, just a
century from what appears to have been its first adoption.</p>

<p>On comparing the three books above mentioned, the curious
fact is disclosed that the 1764 book does not belong to the same
series as the 1768 and the 1775 books. The front cover and
first pages of all three books are missing, but there is sufficient
internal evidence to show clearly that the two later books form
part of the series known as the ‘Underwriters’ Register,’ which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</span>
gradually developed into or rather led up to the establishment
of Lloyd’s Register. The earliest of them is supposed to date
from 1760; whether the 1764 book is a rival which started
immediately after it, or belonged to a Register Society which
existed previously to 1760, is not known, but the latter is perhaps
most probable. Its existence might, it is thought, have debarred
the new Register Book from using the Roman capitals, and it is
no great stretch to suppose that the old book had ceased before
1775, and left its successor free to adopt the designation or
class A 1.</p>

<p>The book dated 1764-5 furnished the following particulars:
Ship’s name, master and owner’s name, ports of trading, tonnage,
when and where built, number and kind of guns, and number of
men and the class of the ship. In the book dated 1775, the load-draught
of water was given, but not the number of men. The
Register Book was at this latter date published annually, and
the corrections from time to time were posted or stamped in the
books by means of type as at present. In the earlier books the
revisions during the year, or rather two years—for the books
were then biennial—had to be inserted with pen and ink. The
following particulars have been for the most part obtained by
an examination of old Register Books, but they are necessarily
incomplete, as many of the early volumes were lost when the
Royal Exchange was burnt down in 1838.</p>

<p>In the book for 1778 a list of ships of the Royal Navy is inserted,
also a list of the ships in the East India Company’s service.
General meetings used in those old days to be held by the subscribers
(then termed members), of whom there were, at the end
of 1780, 164. The subscription which at first was twelve guineas
was eventually, about 1810, reduced to eight guineas, the funded
property of the Register Society having reached 12,000<i>l.</i> For
twenty years, afterwards, however, the expenses exceeded the
income by 500<i>l.</i> per annum, and the subscription was, in consequence,
raised to ten guineas. The particulars in the book for
1788, a copy of which is extant, were much as formerly; but a
few curious additions had come to be inserted, such as whether
the vessel had deep waists or low counters, and whether American
property: and a record was made of the description of timber of
which the ships were built, the number of decks, and if the
beams were kneed. In 1798, the number of subscribers amounted
to 245, and the number of members on the committee, who served
gratuitously, was eleven. In that year’s book the Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</span>
ships are not inserted. In 1799, a number of Shipowners started
an opposition book, termed the ‘Red Book,’ which continued until
1833. In 1824, it would appear that vessels supplied with iron
cables did not receive the figure 1 or 2 unless they had hempen
cables as well; and then, for the first time, the letters PIC
were inserted against them, denoting that the iron cables had
been proved. It does not appear by any of the early books we
have examined that the class was given for any specified number
of years, but it was omitted whenever the ship had not been
surveyed within three years. It seems, however, to be an established
fact that vessels were allowed to retain the A 1 character
for a certain number of years, the number being entirely dependent
on the port at which she was built, and varying from
twelve years for a London built ship, to five to six years for a
north country built ship. After those years had elapsed, the
vessel became of the second class, and no amount of repairs or
strengthening would enable her to be replaced as an A 1 ship.
Here were two principles involved in classification obviously
unsound. The first encouraged inferior building, and the second
discouraged ships being efficiently repaired.</p>

<p>These and other mischievous tendencies were entirely removed
when, in 1834, the two previously existing societies became united
in the present ‘Lloyd’s Register of British and Foreign Shipping.’</p>

<p>The object sought in establishing the existing society was to
class vessels according to their intrinsic merits, so as to indicate
by the class, as nearly as might be, the efficiency and value of
each vessel. The subscription to the Register Book was fixed at
three guineas. Rules were published, and surveyors appointed
to survey vessels while building, as well as afterwards. The
committee of the new register was constituted, as it is at present,
of merchants, Shipowners, and underwriters, elected in
equal proportions. Eight underwriters and four merchants are
elected by the Committee of Lloyd’s, and eight Shipowners and
four merchants are elected by the General Shipowners’ Society.
In addition to the foregoing, the chairman of Lloyd’s and the
chairman of the General Shipowners’ Society are ex-officio
members of the Committee.</p>

<p>The Committee of Lloyd’s Register was, later on, still further
augmented by the admission of eight members elected to represent
the port of Liverpool, two to represent the Clyde, and three the
north-east coast of England, one to represent Hull, and one Bristol.</p>

<p>The Register Book for 1834 included both classed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</span>
unclassed ships, but the latter were allowed to gradually drop
out, until the ‘Register’ contained almost exclusively classed
ships. Few particulars at that time were given of the vessels
beyond the tonnage (old), the date and place of build, the
captain’s and owner’s names, and the port of registry.</p>

<p>The rules as first issued for the building of wood ships were
brief and general, but slight reference being made to wood
steamers, which were then few in number. The first iron
vessels classed in the Register Book were the <i>Sirius</i>, of 180 tons,
built at London in 1837, and the <i>Ironside</i>, built at Liverpool in
1838; they had the A 1 class assigned without a term of years,
and iron vessels were subsequently classed in the same way
until 1854, when rules for their construction were framed, twelve
A 1, nine A 1, and six A 1 classes, respectively, being assigned
under those rules. In 1863 the mode of classing iron ships was
altered to /A\ 1, /B\ 1, and /C\ 1. Rules for the building of composite
ships (iron frames planked with wood) were devised in 1867,
and the vessels were classed A 1 for a term of years. In 1870
new rules for the construction of iron ships were framed, based
on the dimensions of vessels instead of on tonnage as formerly,
and the class of iron vessels was altered from the monogram
system indicated above to 100 A 1, 90 A 1, and 80 A 1;<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</span>and this is the mode of classing now in force. But to go
back a few years:—In 1841 another register society was constituted
at Liverpool, which existed for four years, and was in
1845 amalgamated with ‘Lloyd’s Register.’ In 1863 Lloyd’s
Register Book was enlarged, and the registered length, breadth,
and depth of the ships were given in addition to other particulars.
In 1870, its size was still further increased. The book
in 1874 received great additions, and is about four times the size
of that issued in 1834. It now contains all British ships classed
and unclassed of 100 tons and above, in addition to many vessels
of smaller size, and those of other nations which have obtained
classification therein, or others of sufficient importance to be
inserted. The rules for shipbuilding were in 1874 also carefully
revised, and issued with the enlarged book.</p>

<p>The information it contains may now be said to be very
complete, for few particulars are omitted which are likely to be
required in the ordinary course of business. Steps have been
taken to publish the rules in the principal European languages,
and I learn that already translations into the French, German,
and Italian languages have been completed, and are in the press.</p>

<p>From the current Register Book it will be seen that there are
now nearly 3000 subscribers, and there are about 8000 vessels
classed, in addition to those of which the class is temporarily
suspended, pending repairs or survey, or for some other cause.
At the present time nearly the whole of the shipbuilding in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</span>
United Kingdom is under the survey of the Society’s surveyors
for classification in the Register Book. On the 31st of March,
1874, there were building, under special survey in various parts
of the world, 655 vessels of a total tonnage of 543,918 tons to
class at Lloyd’s. On the 30th of June, 1874, the number of
vessels building under special survey was 660, of a tonnage
of 516,109 tons.</p>

<p>The vast amount of shipping, now being built to class in
Lloyd’s Register, is doubtless due chiefly to the confidence
which the British shipping community repose in the Society’s
present rules for the building of vessels, and the manner in
which they are administered.</p>

<p>In Italy, France, and the Netherlands there appears to be a
manifest tendency towards classification in Lloyd’s Register, and
foreign Shipowners, and even large companies—such as the
General Transatlantic Company—are submitting their vessels to
this Society’s survey for classification, thus placing them on an
equality with ships belonging to this country.</p>

<p>During the recent agitation with respect to shipping in
Canada, the Canadian Government communicated with the
Committee of ‘Lloyd’s Register’ on the project of instituting
a Canadian registry, and the following extract from the letter
of the Canadian Ministry dated 11th July, 1873, is of interest as
showing the high repute in which the Institution of which we
are now writing is held in our North American Colonies:—</p>

<p>“The Minister of Marine<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> is not unmindful of the great
benefits conferred on the shipping of this country by the establishment
of Lloyd’s surveyors at Quebec, New Brunswick, and
Prince Edward Island some years previous to the establishment
of surveyors for ‘Bureau Veritas’ in this country, and in
making his arrangements for the establishment of a Canadian
registry, and the framing of rules and regulations for inspection
and classification under it, he feels desirous to assimilate the
system under which it will be worked to that of your institution,
which is controlled by British sentiment, and has the confidence
of such a large portion of the shipowners of the world,
and the officers of which possess such great experience in all
these matters.”</p>

<p>In judging of the value of ‘Lloyd’s Register of Shipping,’ it
is important to observe that it is, essentially, a public body,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</span>having no pecuniary or commercial purposes to serve beyond
those of the public interest, because (with the exception of a
moderate fee to the Committee for their attendance) the whole
of its receipts are devoted to the interests of shipping, to the
extension of the society’s staff of surveyors, who are now
stationed at all parts of the United Kingdom and in many
places abroad, the improvement of the Register Book and other
matters of public importance.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to speak too highly of the value of this great
institution. It had its failings, and I recollect that, a quarter
of a century ago, I made various attacks upon it through the public
press; and, on the ground of its maintaining certain rules for
classification, which I conceived were unsound in principle, I
declined to classify any of my ships with the society. But all
these rules have been long since altered; and when I look back
to that time and compare the quality of ships then launched
to those of the present day, it is impossible to question the great
value of the services this institution has rendered to the country.
A ship that would have had an A 1 class assigned to her forty
years ago, would now be considered barely seaworthy.</p>

<p>Here we have another instance of the valuable work done in
this country without Government aid or interference in any
shape or form. A few individuals, for their own protection as
well as for the protection of the public, associate themselves
together, and, by their organisation, do perhaps more to save life
and property at sea than all the laws which have been passed
having that object in view. For the success of this valuable
institution, its members, and I must add, the public, are greatly
indebted to Mr. Thomas Chapman, <span class="allsmcap">F.R.S.</span>, who has been its
chairman almost from its commencement in 1834, and who has
devoted the best years of his life, sparing neither time nor
labour to raise it to its present high position, while displaying
a tact and sound judgment throughout in the management of its
affairs rarely to be met with, combined with an honesty of
purpose which must ever command respect and admiration. Nor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</span>has he lacked able and indefatigable colleagues, some of whom,
as, for instance, the late Mr. William Tindall and Mr. Duncan
Dunbar, and now Mr. George Marshall, Mr. W. H. Tindall, and
others, have been active members of the Committee for a large
portion of their lives. But not the least important secret
of its success has been its complete system of organisation, and
the competency of all persons connected with it for their respective
duties, while the many checks upon its various branches
tend to keep the working of the business of the society free from
those temptations to which men holding responsible appointments
are too frequently subjected. For instance, there is a chief
surveyor, who has two assistants acting directly under him, and
through whom all important reports from the different surveyors
must pass, before being laid before the Committee, many of
whom know quite as much about ship-building as the surveyors
themselves—then all these surveyors are under the secretary,
Mr. B. Waymouth, a gentleman of great practical knowledge and
remarkable ability. If there is anything wrong, he will be sure
soon to detect it; for, during the twenty-one years with which
he has been connected with the society, he has gone through the
different grades, from assistant-surveyor to chief-surveyor, acting
as chief of the staff for some time before receiving the appointment
of secretary. There are also annual visits of inspection
made to all the principal building ports by the chairman and
members of the Committee, the secretary, and chief surveyor.
Moreover, the surveyors are not all located permanently, some
being from time to time changed, and a feeling pervades the
whole staff that if any one passes imperfect workmanship or
materials, the fact is likely to be brought to light by the surveyors
who follow, who are bound to report any apparent laxity,
which is invariably inquired into by the Committee, and dealt
with as circumstances require.</p>

<p>That the survey and classification of ships has been of immense
advantage in saving life and property at sea may be seen
by the following table. Here we see, that the losses of vessels
classed at Lloyd’s have not, during the last three years, been
one-half of the unclassed, and that for the eighteen months
ending 30th January, 1875, while the percentage of loss of all
vessels from all causes classed at Lloyd’s has been only 5·25
per cent., the losses of vessels unclassed, or not classed by that
association, has been 12·32 per cent. These figures speak
volumes in favour of the society.</p>

<p>It would thus appear that, since the Navigation Laws were
repealed in 1849, Government has passed no less than forty-one
Acts of Parliament, and introduced seven Bills not yet passed,
many of them great and important measures, besides laying
before Parliament numerous instructive and interesting papers,
all of them devoted expressly to the purpose of improving our
merchant ships and the condition of our merchant seamen. It
is idle, and worse than idle, after these facts, to charge the
respective Governments, since 1849, with having neglected the
interests of our mercantile marine, and the best answer to such
mischievous and unjust charges is the present very high position
in all respects of our merchant fleets as compared with those
of all other nations.</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Maritime Relations.</span>”</p>

<p>“Remarks of Mr. W. S. Lindsay, M.P., at the Chamber of Commerce
meeting, Tuesday evening, 9th October.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lindsay said: ... With these preliminary remarks, allow me to
state to you the objects which I have in view in meeting you this evening. I
will speak first in reference to the liability of Shipowners, because that,
perhaps, is one of the most important questions, and one which I think is not
sufficiently understood. I do not think that it is generally known how the
Shipowners of both countries stand with regard to each other on this question.
As our respective laws now stand, any Shipowner of this country or of England,
however wealthy, may rise any morning and find himself a ruined man. That
is a serious thing to consider. The law of England limits the responsibility
of our Shipowners to the value of the ship and freight. In most other
countries of Europe the responsibility of the Shipowners is also limited to a
similar extent. That is likewise the law in this country, as far as I understand
your law. That is to say, if one of your ships runs down another at sea,
and you pay into your courts the value of the ship and freight, your responsibility
cannot be carried beyond that value. Now this is very good so far as
the laws of the respective countries stand. But if my ship runs down another
ship in which any American subject is interested, I am made responsible, in
your courts, not merely for the value of my ship and freight, but for whatever
amount of damage may have been sustained through the collision brought
about by my ship. Therefore if my ship runs down a vessel with cargo and
freight on board to the extent of 200,000<i>l.</i> sterling, I would be responsible for
the whole. If, on the other hand, your ships at sea run down any other ship
in which a British subject is interested, and the action for loss is raised in our
courts, you are held responsible for the full amount of the damage which your
ship caused. This arises from the fact that our laws have jurisdiction only
over British ships, and your laws have jurisdiction over only American ships.
Now, considering the vast trade which is carried on between the two countries,
I hope you may agree with me in the opinion, that as the laws of both
countries are similar, the Shipowner’s liability in the courts of either country
should in all cases be limited to the value of the ship and freight. I hope
you will use your influence to extend that limitation to the vessels of both
countries, which might easily be done by a convention between the two
nations....”</p>

<p>100 A, 90 A, and 80 A, will denote vessels that have been built in accordance
with, or equal to, the Rules, and Tables G 1, G 2, G 3, and G 4. Where deviations
from the Rules are desired, a sketch of the midship section, plans, &amp;c.,
must be first submitted, through the resident Surveyor, for the Committee’s
approval, and the vessel built in accordance with the approved plans, under
the Survey of the Surveyors to the Society.</p>

<p>Iron Ships built in accordance with previous Rules remain on the characters
assigned to them.</p>

<p>All vessels must be submitted to occasional or <i>Annual Surveys</i> when
practicable; and to entitle them to retain their characters in the ‘Register
Book,’ Special Surveys must be held at intervals of three and four years,
according to the Class assigned.</p>

<p class="center">WOOD SHIPS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ships Classed A 1</span> <i>for a term of Years</i>.—Section 34 requires that they shall
be occasionally surveyed; <i>Annually</i> if practicable. If not placed under <i>half-time
or intermediate</i> Surveys within periods not exceeding four years—or, in
the case of the higher classed vessels, one-half of the terms of years originally
assigned to them—their Characters will be liable to be withdrawn from the
‘Register Book.’</p>

<p>Sections 54 to 58 provide for the Continuation or Restoration of the
Character A 1 for further periods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ships Classed A 1</span> <i>in Red</i>.—Section 60 provides for the Survey and Classing
of Ships A 1 in Red, which is also a Class of vessels fit for the safe conveyance
of dry and perishable goods <i>to and from all parts of the world</i>. They are
allowed to retain this Character upon <i>Special Survey</i>, for terms in no case
exceeding <i>two-thirds</i> the periods originally assigned to them.</p>

<p>They are also subject to Annual Survey, and to the half-time Survey
prescribed in Section 34.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ships Classed Æ</span>, for the conveyance of dry and perishable goods on <i>shorter

<p>Section 65 requires that they should be submitted to <i>Annual</i> Survey, and
to Special Survey within periods not exceeding <i>three</i> years.</p>

<p>Provision is made in the Rules for the Classification of Composite Ships;
also of Foreign-built Ships constructed not in accordance with the Rules.</p>

<p>As all vessels are required to be surveyed periodically, the <i>date of Survey</i>
is the criterion of their state of efficiency <i>at that time only</i>.</p>
